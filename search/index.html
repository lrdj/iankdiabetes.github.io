<p>
Client-side search using <a href="http://lunrjs.com/">Lunr</a>. Type in the box to trigger results. To keep the index a reasonable size this only searches relatively recent posts. If you want to search everything for the last 15 years(?!?) you need to go to the <a href="/search/archival/">archival search</a> and be patient as the index is almost 2Mb.</p>

<input placeholder="Search&hellip;" type="search" id="search" class="search-input">
<div id="results" class="all-posts results"></div>
