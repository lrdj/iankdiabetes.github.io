<p>I am grateful for Virgin Atlantic's in-flight entertainment, and in particular, their natty disposable headphones;-)</p>

<p>I remember (OK, turning forty tomorrow&mdash;so lots of irritating reminiscing on the horizon...) when you had to pay for your peanuts and the 'stewardess' (remember those? they preceded the 'flight attendant') would do the rounds on landing and collect these cheesy headphones that were no more than rubber hoses. Not of course, that they would have had any use outside the plane but anyway...</p>
