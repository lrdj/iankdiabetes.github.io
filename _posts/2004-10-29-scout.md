<p>&#8230;Boy Scouts and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">S&amp;M </span></span>fetishists both spend an inordinate amount of time fiddling with rope&#8230;</p>

<p>I mean I don&#8217;t have a problem with pain or yuckiness or whatever otherwise weirds people out about various fetishes, it&#8217;s just that I can&#8217;t get all hot and bothered about watching someone spend fifteen minutes adjusting cross-tailed toe-loops and half-hitches around a naked woman hanging from the ceiling :-)</p>
