<p>Hi Chris,</p>

<p>Heard about this horrible thing. I don't know if it helps, but I found <a href="http://www.esqwire.com/dada.shtml">this</a> via Dug's friend <a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/jasr/">Jose Antonio's blog</a></p>

<p>It's a decision about a dispute over the domain name www.dada.com. Jose Antonio's brother, Juan Carlos, was sued by a sportswear company called dada and he won. I'm not sure I totally get it, but it seems that some of the relevant things are "legitimate interest", whether there is a "confusing similarity" with the names, whether you have a "sufficient interest" in the name.</p>

<p>Anyway, maybe Juan-Carlos or his lawyers could help you.</p>

<p>Hope you get it all sorted. What a bloody annoying bore,</p>

<p>Billy</p>
