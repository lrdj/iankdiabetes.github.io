<p>So ever since seeing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067756/">Silent Running</a> when I was a teenager, I've had a strange attraction to gardening, not that I ever did anything about it. Nicki getting the garden organised kind of gave me a boost&#8212;I've started weeding and dead-heading, I'm growing a herb garden and have been buying seeds and germinating them in a tray in the kitchen.</p>

<p>I still don't know exactly where this is going but I'm going to try and keep some notes as I find stuff out&#8230;</p>
