<p>OK everybody, today's the day. Time to head for a polling station.</p>

<p>I've been struggling with what to do--I've always thought Tony Blair was slimey, but having to ditch Glenda Jackson (my MP) to get to get rid Tony seemed harsh and strangely pointless.</p>

<p>I had just about primed myself for getting the tories back in when our local LibDem candidate helped me out. The guy has posted a note stating that he is standing down and we should all vote for Glenda. Talk about a sense of relief. Polls open in Nine minutes, must get shoes on...</p>
