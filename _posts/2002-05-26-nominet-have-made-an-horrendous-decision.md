<p>The following reproduced from <a href="http://www.nominet-no.co.uk/">http://www.nominet-no.co.uk/</a></p>

<p><q> ...they are planning on publishing private home postal addresses, for personal web-domains which are registered through them; that's <span class="caps">ALL </span>the .uk Top Level Domains which includes the .co.uk Sub-Domain. Nominet will be introducing an expanded <span class="caps">WHOIS </span>reply format this summer. In line with the format used by other Registries, the new <span class="caps">WHOIS </span>will include the name and address of the domain name Registrant. </q></p>

<p>I have to say, I've always felt that the chaps at Nominet were a bit of a piss-take, I mean have you tried becoming a Nominet tag holder? The amount they expect you to pay for nought is shocking. I've just started boycotting their top-level domain...</p>
