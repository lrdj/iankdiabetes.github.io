<p><a title="robbevan.com ï¿½ Raccoon: Apache on S60" href="http://robbevan.com/blog/2006/05/03/raccoon-apache-on-s60/">Apache on Symbian</a>. Just imagine what you could do with that (updating walled gardens in poor connection areas for example). Now if only I was smart enough to install and try this thing myself;-)</p>

<p>This from the Nokia faq page:</p>

<blockquote><p>In general, it is better not to think web server that happens to be on a mobile device but instead personal context-rich mobile device with <span class="caps">HTTP </span>access to it. Technically they say the same thing, but the latter alternative describes much better what this is all about.</p></blockquote>
