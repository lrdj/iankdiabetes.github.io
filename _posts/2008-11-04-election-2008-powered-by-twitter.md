<p>Man this is something, the twitter election feed which uses a script to update the stream (see <a href="http://election.twitter.com/">election.twitter.com</a>) is now scrolling almost continuously. I'll bet that'll hammer a browser or two...</p>

<p>So OK America, what'll it be? </p>

<p>Behind door number one: that Hitler chap hasn't done anything bad to us and those Europeans are always getting themselves in trouble with their corrupt old-world ways. Let's just look inwards and stay out of trouble.</p>

<p>Behind door number two: Ola! Tag! Salama! Kumasta! Nî hâo! Hey let's all reach out and work together to save this sinking ship of a planet.</p>

<p>So vote, OK? You know what to do!</p>
