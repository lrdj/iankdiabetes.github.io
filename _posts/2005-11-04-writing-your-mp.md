<p>Sometimes we forget that the laws we obey are written (indirectly) by us.</p>

<p>If you want to sort something out, you can join a lobbying group (fat lot of good that <a href="http://www.trf.org.uk/news.php?OP=25">did me</a>) but more satisfying in the short term is contacting your <span class="caps">MP.</span> I was trying to figure out the best way to write to <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/glenda_jackson/hampstead_and_highgate">Glenda Jackson</a> when I came across this lovely little <a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">application that directs emails to your MP</a>. Now I have no excuse to ignore my constitutional responsibilities</p>
