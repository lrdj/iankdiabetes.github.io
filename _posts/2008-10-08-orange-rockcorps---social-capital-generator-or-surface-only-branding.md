<p>Just saw Tim's piece on the <a href="http://www.glasshousepartnership.com/blog/orange-rockcorps-volunteering-yes-andwheres-the-social-capital/">Glasshouse</a> blog on Orange Rockcorps and understanding the value of the social capital.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rockcorps.com/" title="visit the original rockcorps site in the US"><img alt="Rockcorps intro graphic" src="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/rockcorps.gif" width="244" height="139" class="mt-image-left" style="border:none;float: left; margin: 0 1em 0.5em 0;" /></a></p>

<p>From there I had a quick look around and wow, quite a lot of negative opinion out there and a surprisingly <a href="http://www.brandrepublic.com/Discipline/Creative/57011/orange-rockcorps-fallon/">downbeat response</a> to the Orange rockcorps thing over at brandrepublic:</p>

<blockquote><i>This is incredibly lame. The Orange 'I Am' campaign just limps from bad to worse. Busta Rhymes? What year are we in? 1999? I can't remember the last campaign from Fallon that was any good.</i></blockquote>

<p>I guess there's a gap between <a href="http://www.rockcorps.com/">the original</a> and the Orange "I am" branded version? This is how the rc site describes the initiative:</p>

<blockquote><p>RockCorps harnesses the power of music to inspire volunteering. We produce concerts for which the only way in is to volunteer 4 hours at a project we organize with non-profit partners. You can't win a ticket; you can't buy a ticket; you have to earn a ticket to a concert that becomes a celebration of giving back.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.timkitchin.com">Tim</a> reckons </p>

<blockquote><p>If the company makes it work, it's the energy and community productivity generated that will constitute the value of the initiative; not the <span class="caps">SMS </span>bundles sold. The number of hours donated, or playgrounds renovated is a wholly inadequate proxy for the social capital generated by a campaign like this...</p></blockquote>
