<p>The big Visa widget at the top has the shape, drop-shadow design and position of a search input box. This one kept trying to convince the auto-pilot part of my web users brain that I should click on it. </p>

<p>In the process of Googling the stuff I was looking for I came back to the site a few times before finally noticing the tiny search interface hidden in the grey bar at the bottom. I reckon I need to start testing search styles and positions (there seems to be a bit of a trend for moving away from top-right and into top-centre) but this is ridiculous.</p>
