<th></th><th>the good</th><th>the bad</th></tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th>Appleness</th><td>lovely interface with apps that launch instantly and give great real-time feedback (Googlemaps is almost perfect but for one <em>feature</em> that sort of kills it)</td><td>no charge in the battery means no <em>out-of-box</em> experience (if you've ever unpacked an imac you'll know what I mean)</td></tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th>OS-design</th><td>no app-switcher</td><td>no app-switcher</td></tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th>handfeel</th><td>virtual keyboard works with one-handed hand-and-thumb (contrary to what early handset-expert nay-sayers claimed when the device launched)</td><td>really crummy soft ergonomics. I've almost dropped the thing twice. I could have used little rubber nipples on the back or etched grooves on the sides</td></tr>

<p>I'll add to this as I get used to the device...</p>
