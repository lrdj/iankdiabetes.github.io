<p>According to <span class="caps">IPSOS </span>(Institut something something something?) the turnout was 71.60 percent. Why did I think that the turnout was poor? Now I'm really confused, I guess the figure I need is what percent of the population make up the electorate (40% maybe?) to whittle it down to knowing how many actual bodies made it to the polling booth (Le Pen claims one of his biggest supporters died leaving the hospital to go and cast her ballot for him - does he miss a beat) and finally, what percentage does that represent of the whole population. Or in simple terms, 1 in x French people are fascists?</p>

<p>Oh well, I guess this means we should make a point of getting out there for our next poll (coming up soon but I forget the date). Recently, I've voted Socialist Workers Party and Green as Tony Blair's capitalist non-leftism was getting me seriously down.</p>

<p>Ok ok ok - big T your lot gets my vote this time...</p>
