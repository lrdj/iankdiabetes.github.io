<p>Scoble wants us to link to <a title="Scobleizer â Tech geek blogger » Blog Archive Why Microsoft will buy Facebook and keep it closed «" href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/05/19/why-microsoft-will-buy-facebook-and-keep-it-closed/">this</a></p>

<p>He's got a point, this is potentially very worrying (and is also something I just wouldn't have guessed would happen):</p>

<blockquote><p>This is a fight for the Web. We all just crawled inside a box that locks Google out.<br />Don’t believe me?<br />Go to Google and do a search for “Le Web 08.��?<br />Do you see a Facebook entry there? Nope. Google is locked out of the Web.<br />This has created <span class="caps">HUGE </span>value for Microsoft and has handed Steve Ballmer an Internet strategy which brings Microsoft from last place to first in less than a week.<br />Boom!</p></blockquote>

<p>Scary stuff indeed...</p>
