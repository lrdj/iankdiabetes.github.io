<p>On the eight o'clock boat to Calais. Left home at quarter to five and got to Calais fourty-five minutes early grrrr (could have slept more...). Our little clan is heading to Italy for the next two weeks--Nicki is flying with <span class="caps">CLF </span>and I'm driving the 'support vehicle'. Interesting drive ahead I hope...</p>
