<p>I wonder if Microsoft would be willing to pay me for the hours I lose attemping to repair damage caused by their software? Office v.X is beautiful to look at, but has a number of 'surprise' features designed to waste as much administrator time as possible.</p>

<p>nice.</p>

<p>Maybe I'll start keeping a tab of the hours and send them an invoice...</p>
