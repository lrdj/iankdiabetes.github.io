<p>Looks a lot nicer on the iPhone screen. Funny how jpeg and co. do a great job of compressing images with a high level of complexity but subtle tones and slight tonal range really fall apart on digital. Not enough depth per pixel to deliver, need to shoot it in 16-bit of something... Still, lovely sand:-)</p>
