<p>today if you haven't already. I went against my better judgement and voted for the Tony candidates for all three seats. I'm still cross with Labour and in local government I reckon Camden could use some Green Party seats but I'm feeling the LePen effect here...</p>

<p>So go out and vote, polls close at 19:00</p>
