<p>I got this note at work this morning. This is crazy as it's now the second time I've got the note and for some reason, this company cannot operate outside its scripted customer support parameters. This a very important course that I am supposed to complete as part of my job, but due to their limited approach, we're stuck in a loop. I tried a different reply this morning, fingers crossed they'll sort it out :-)</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Dug Falby, </p>

<p>You have yet to finish the following xxxxxxxxx courses: </p>

<p>Anti-money laundering course (deadline: 2005-03-03)</p>

<p>Please log in to http://www.xxxxxxxx.com/training to complete your course(s). The assignments will be found under 'Courses'. </p>

<p>The deadline has passed so it is important that you finish the course as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Regards, <br />
xxxxxxx xxxxx-xxxxx <br />
Compliance </p></blockquote>

<p>And my reply...</p>

<blockquote><p>I cannot complete the course as my computer will not run your dodgy Java applet.</p>

<p>Please supply one of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>- a different Java applet</li>
<li>- a non-java alternative version</li>
<li>- a different computer.</li>
</ol>

<p>Until you supply the above, I will not be able to complete your course.</p>

<p>Best,<br />
Dug Falby</p></blockquote>

<p>So fingers crossed...</p>
