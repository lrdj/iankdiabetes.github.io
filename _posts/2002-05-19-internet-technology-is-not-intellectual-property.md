<p>To whom it/05/concern:</p>

<p>I recently read of your patent infringement lawsuit against Dickson supply and ten others.</p>

<p>Web-based systems cannot be protected by patent. It is foolish to assume otherwise and I am pretty sure that this little tomfoolery of yours is going to bite you in your corporate ass.</p>

<p>You/05/protect your written creations (including software) with copyright and you/05/prevent those that you trade with from stealing your business secrets by issuing non-disclosure agreements.</p>

<p>But you can't patent what happens between computers on a network using html - much the same way you can copyright a book but you can't patent the English language.</p>

<p>As news of your heinous activity spreads across the internet, you will find yourself increasingly under pressure to desist. I urge you to stop now before this gets out of hand.</p>

<p>Regards, Dug</p>
