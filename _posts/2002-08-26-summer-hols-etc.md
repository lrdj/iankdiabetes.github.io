<p>I was going to say I'm now back at work and describe hols etc etc but i just found the following in my inbox from Jed, my father and I thought it kind of did the job:-)</p>

<p><q> ...summer's rollin' on in Devon and we have the kids out every day playing Croquet ("Croquet is <span class="caps">O.Q</span>uet!"). The miracle is that each day has been more sunny than the last...Full Moon reflecting off the warm calm silver sea and the remains of the fire for the Bar-B-Q on the still warm pebbles. These last few days have been like the remembered summers of my long gone boyhood. Of course I know that Memory lies, but humans have the great skill of forgetting the bad bits (whole summers of rain!). If we didn't have this skill of forgetting no Mothers would ever bear children... </q></p>
