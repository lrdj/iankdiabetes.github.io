<p>I've just discovered that James (Cherkoff) is in Sri Lanka and he's <span class="caps">OK.</span> He normally checks in with a nudge to get a move on the day he's back after Christmas, but this year, silence--Turns out Liz and James arrived just as the wave was hitting. They were in a restaurant high up on a hill when it happened. </p>

<p>Nicki's sister lost a relative in Thailand, positive ID from dental records:-(</p>
