<p>Bob was livid when he found out about L8 tickets changing hands for loads of cash online. I saw him on TV a couple of days ago really laying into eBay. I'm not sure if this was Bob's idea, but someone suggested bidders enter absurd amounts to sabotage the auctions and undermine eBay's system.</p>

<p>This must have worked as folk started entering nonsense bids (all for 10-Million pounds, the amount suggested by Bob) and now eBay has decided to stop the auctions...</p>

<p>Way to go Bob :-)</p>

<p>Dear all,</p>

<p>Today you have made it very clear to us that our previous decision to allow the sale of <span class="caps">LIVE</span> 8 tickets on eBay.co.uk was not one that the vast majority of you agreed with. As a result of this clear signal from the Community we have decided to prohibit the resale of <span class="caps">LIVE</span> 8 tickets on the site.</p>

<p>Although the resale of tickets is not illegal, we think that this is absolutely the right thing to do. We have listened to the views you expressed on the discussion boards and in the many emails you have sent to us. We shall be working over the next few hours to remove all <span class="caps">LIVE</span> 8 ticket listings from the site.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to contact us and make your views heard,</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Doug McCallum<br />
Managing Director, eBay (UK) Ltd.<br />
On behalf of the whole eBay.co.uk team</p></blockquote>
