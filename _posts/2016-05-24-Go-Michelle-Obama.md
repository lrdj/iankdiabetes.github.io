Just seen this [Good magazine](https://www.good.is/articles/new-fda-labels) post about the new US Government food and drug administration (FDA) food labels. Love it that the US sugar lobby [is pissed off](https://www.sugar.org/the-sugar-association-statement-on-fdas-added-sugars-declaration/) and goes through crazy loops to say the there is no scientific evidence to support the FDA's decision:

> We are concerned that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent [...] FDA has openly admitted it deviated from factors traditionally considered for mandatory declaration of nutrients on the NFL (i.e. chronic disease, health-related conditions)

So in plain English, the sugar lobby is saying there is no connection between the management of sugar consumption and the obesity and diabetes crisis (yes, wtf?!?)

![The new FD labels aren't a game-changer as such but they mark a key milestone in public health:-)](/assets/i/new-fda-labels.png)

How do these lobbyists sleep at night. Diabetes levels are running totally out of control, it's got to the point where it is so bad it's almost turning to farce.

On it's own this isn't going to reverse the type-2 diabetes situation but it sure as hell will help and if we set a precedent of beating the food lobby that's got to be a good thing for the future:-)
