<p>Couple of weeks ago I was on hols in Avignon with the whole extended Falby clan and we all wrote games for the evening's entertainment. Margaret, Nicki's mum came up with a devilishly difficult Balderdash (I knew only two of the ten words) and I did a pub-quiz.</p>

<p>Don't know if you've set a pub-quiz before but this was my first go and and was way more difficult than I had anticipated. It's not enough to find things people might not know--you need to try and prevent folk getting bored and you need to make the questions relevant to your audience. In my case I had an audience of three 70-year-olds, three 40-year-olds, two teenagers and <span class="caps">CLF </span>who is six now and was supposed to be in bed (she helped by numbering the questions and that's her below trying her first diabolo menthe).</p>

<p>Tricky stuff. </p>

<p>At the end of the evening Billy--who knows about these things--reassured me that I had got it about right as the two teams scored better than average but not so much as to make it seem easy.</p>

<p>I'm on the flight back from Chicago listening to Laura Cantrell's version of <em>The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald</em> while flying over Lake Erie (which is kinda weird) and was going to do a little work (and write some stuff about Seed) when I found the quiz questions in my bag.</p>
