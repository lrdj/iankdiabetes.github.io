<p>Safe???!! <span class="caps">WTF </span>does that mean?!! This from the Flickr help files:</p>

<blockquote><p>My account has been reviewed as safe. What does that mean?</p>

<p>Having a "safe" account means that you are good at moderating your own content. Awesome!</p></blockquote>

<p>"Good at moderating your own content" wow that sounds creepy. I hate it when I read something like this that intellectually I know is right but somewhere hidden at the back there's a little alarm bell that goes off... Now if I could only work out what it was.</p>

<p>One of the Flickr posters in my contacts has had a lot of grief with her regular readers complaining that they could no longer see her pictures. I've been doing a little reading ever since I became a libellous Flickr user (can you libel someone in an email address? I'm sure there's a precendent out there...) and you know, this <a title="Flickr: Help: Content filters" href="http://www.flickr.com/help/filters/#252">Flickr content filter thing</a> is really getting up my nose.</p>

<p>Anyway, am not liking the feeling of being 'handled' this is definitely not the Flickr experience I signed up for.</p>
