<p>I make tracy Island out of yellow play-do and get as far as the nice abstract blob of the island, the runway with the fold-back trees and am just starting on the Mies <span class="caps">VDR </span>square buildings when <span class="caps">CLF </span>attacks and eats the buildings.</p>

<p>She then eats them just as quickly as i can shape them...</p>
