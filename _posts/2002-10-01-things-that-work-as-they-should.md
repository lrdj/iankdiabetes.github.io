<p>Just ordered Adrian Frutiger's <a href="http://www.perrousseaux.com/Perrousseaux.asp?Page=Accueil">l'Homme et ses signes</a> in a rather delicious edition by Atelier Perrousseaux. I believe he wrote the original in German, but this edition from 2000 updates and refines the French edition of 1983 (and I suppose he would have written in French rather than English...)</p>

<p>I ordered it from amazon.fr and when I got to the checkout and saw the familiar logon, I assumed that I'd have to create a duplicate account for the French company. But woohoo:-) my .co.uk user/pass work fine, all the customer database details (inc. credit card) are pan-national (odd, as <span class="caps">SKU </span>data does not appear to be shared by the main application). I don't know if this is even legal? In any case, it makes ordering French books for little <span class="caps">CLF </span>a breeze:-)</p>
