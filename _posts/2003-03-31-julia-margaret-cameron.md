<p>Took <span class="caps">CLF </span>to the National Portrait Gallery yesterday to see the <a href="http://www.npg.org.uk/live/cameron.asp">Julia Margaret Cameron</a> show. She wasn't impressed, but liked the more colourful portraits elsewhere in the museum...</p>

<p>I thought the show was fantastic. Most of the prints are original <span class="caps">XIX </span>century carbon or albumen prints and are truly beautiful. I've never had the chance to see her stuff in the flesh, so this was really a bit of a treat. In particular, I was impressed with the full-size compositions, some prints, presumably made as contact prints from 10 &#215; 8 glass negatives, look 'cropped' in that the composition's elements fit tightly into the frame. I can understand managing light intensity across a face, but I'm guessing her rudimentary camera had a very unclear ground glass, she probably composed the images upside down and most likely couldn't see the edges of her compositions, more likely just a central circle of light in the centre of the screen.</p>

<p>Anyway, I guess it's just that the beauty of her work seems like a fluke at first, until you stand in a room surrounded by it:-) Well worth a visit.</p>
