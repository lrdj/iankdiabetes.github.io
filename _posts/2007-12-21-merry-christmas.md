<p>Well, it's not very Christmassy but Nick was transferring photos and contacts to her new handset and in the process sent me this photograph of <span class="caps">CLF </span>playing in Nicki's wedding outfit. Shame about the item in the background but I love the expression on <span class="caps">CLF'</span>s face, I think we should all feel like that 'round this time of year :-)</p>
