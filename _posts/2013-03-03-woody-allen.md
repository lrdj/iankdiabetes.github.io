<p>Behold your Dad's best Woody Allen expression (yeah, not convinced either). </p>

<p>Mmmmm... OK anyways, not sure why I'm even posting this nonsense but had dinner with a guy who does sculpture last night and he said he was working on a statue of Allen and as we compared notes on how wonderful 3D printers and <span class="caps">CNC </span>milling machines were he mentioned he had his glasses. So I tried them on. For no good reason but am looking for new frames and was thinking of taking the <a href="http://www.michelhenau.com/de/collection">Michel Henau</a> route but these <a href="http://www.moscot.com/lemtosh_117.html">Moscots</a> seem kinda interesting... Order popup below again for absolutely no other reason than it's fun to change the overlay div from 50% black to 100% white in Firebug. Because I can. So why not:-)</p>
