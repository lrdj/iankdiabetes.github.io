<p><q>My father, Jed is living testimony that if you don't have a go, you'll never know how well you could do. The man is unstoppable:-) He sent me this two minutes ago. Go Jed!</q></p>

<p>Just a quick note when there is so much to say...</p>

<p>Jed Falby (Independent)<br /> 1108 votes Yea! Yea! Yahooooo!</p>

<p>Ray Franklin (Conservative)<br /> 1075 votes</p>

<p>Lesley Rodin (Independent)<br /> 975 votes (confirmed at 01:00 this morning after recount)</p>

<p>There was a recount for third position. (There are three seats on East Devon Council) It was ( and I think ,at this time, still is,) a Conservative Controlled Council but we have sure shaken that arrangement up.</p>

<p>I will send you fuller notes later.</p>

<p>I hope I don't turn into a Politician...</p>

<p>Much Love, Dad</p>
