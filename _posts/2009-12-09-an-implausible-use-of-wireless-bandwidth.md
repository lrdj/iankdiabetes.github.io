<p>Love <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/dec/08/music-streaming-cory-doctorow">this Guardian article</a> by Cory Doctorow. It still amazes me that mobile operators spend fortunes trying to put the customer at the heart of the business but don't follow Cory's simple suggestion that giving customers self-determination would solve most of their customer engagement issues at a stroke...</p>

<blockquote><p>What's more, streaming requires that wireless companies be at the centre of our daily cultural lives. These are the same wireless companies that presently screw us in every conceivable way: charging a premium for dialling an 0870 number; having limits on "unlimited" data plans; charging extra for "long distance" text messages. They're the same wireless companies whose hold-queues, deceptive multi-year contracts, surprise bills, and flaky network coverage have caused more bad days than any other modern industry.</p></blockquote>
