<p>So it turns out Cisco have a corporate blog:-) </p>

<p>They even use Movabletype, very kosher. Not sure who is the mind behind the stories, it seems like a PR firm is uploading stuff prompted by employees. In this instance, a note from <a title="News@Cisco Notes" href="http://blogs.cisco.com/news/">Mark Chandler, Cisco's <span class="caps">SVP </span>and General Counsel</a> on the iPhone trademark infringement thing. No amazing news but I'll be keeping an on it...</p>
