<p>Had a very nice day yesterday kicking around London in the sun with <a href="http://www.purplemanchester.co.uk/">Andrew Keith Ward</a></p>

<p>We met up in Borough Market (fantastic - I alway say i should spend more time down there...), drank far too much wine whisky and beer (not in that order) and ended up roaming around the south bank.</p>

<p>At some point we got to convince the woman at the Tate ticket desk that Andy and I are art students who not only must get in to Tate Modern to see the Matisse show forthwith, but that even though we forgot our student cards we should still get the concession.</p>

<p>Enjoyed show v. much :-)</p>

<p>After Tate we tried to squeeze another pint in at the Blackfriars, but it was closed (I've always wanted to go in and check out the amazing pseudo-gothic interior) so instead decided to get sensible and head home :-)</p>
