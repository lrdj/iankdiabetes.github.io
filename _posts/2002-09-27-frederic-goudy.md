<p>Have just downloaded the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/middle_east/02/uk_dossier_on_iraq/pdf/iraqdossier.pdf" title="the Iraq dossier in PDF format">Iraq</a> dossier. While the body of the text is rather crudely set in workmanlike Times Roman, the title page has been worked up by some anonymous designer at the <span class="caps">HMSO.</span></p>

<p>I can sympathise with the designer&mdash;I can see the briefs coming in: "Her Majesty's Government's Response to EC Agricultural Legislation" and so on. Then one day he gets this brief and his boss tells him, "have fun with this one, let rip, let those creative juices flow..." (ok, so they don't really say shit like that at the <span class="caps">HMSO </span>but you get the idea). </p>

<p>So what does he do? He sets it in Goudy. Is this a coincidence? A subliminal message? Does the special relationship include implicating American type designers in our government's warmongering?</p>
