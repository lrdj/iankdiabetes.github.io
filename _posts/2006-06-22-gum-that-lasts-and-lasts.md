Matt, the guy responsible writes about the adventure on his blog: <a title="Where the Hell is Matt? New York, NY It's Done" href="http://www.wherethehellismatt.com/blog/2006/06/20/new-york-ny-its-done/#comments">Where the Hell is Matt? New York, NY It's Done</a></p>

<p>What I want to know is, <em>what exactly is the connection between Matt and Stride gum</em>. </p>

<p>If you head on over to the Stride site, you'll notice the little dancing character on the bottom-left. See how his dance matches Matt's. Now I'm not suggesting foul play here, far from it--it looks like Matt secured sponsorship from an <span class="caps">FMCG </span>company which has allowed him to have a truly life-changing travel experience.</p>

<p>But Matt, could you explain who is the chicken and who is the egg? Is this a brilliant advertising idea or the result of a determined individual's struggle to fund his dream?</p>

<p>Matt?</p>
