<p>Dug,</p>

<p>Remember your posting about the letter from 'Dr. Isah Gambo, Senior Accountant in the office with the Honourable Governor of Central bank of Nigeria'?</p>

<p>This scam is becoming more widespread, it seems (I don't know why, but I've been getting these for years now). Matthew Engel has a piece about it <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,719241,00.html" >here</a> in today's Guardian. He's amazed to find that at least 300 people have fallen for it in the states in the last 8 years. But what percentage is that? The thing with these scams is that you don't need a large percentage of suckers in your target audience to make it worth your while.</p>

<p>Looks like 'the Nigerian letter' is now in the top ten of confidence tricks, and/05/soon be challenging 'the Spanish prisoner' for that number one slot.</p>

<p>B-)</p>
