<p>So I was trying to score some new Birkenstocks at lunchtime today and ended up eating a small Ceasar salad at the bar of the <a href="http://www.tablethotels.com/Hotel/-/300/?google=1">Covent Garden Hotel</a> which seemed like the best way to avoid eating Another Bloody Sandwich.</p>

<p>Decided to wash the salad down with a rather tasty and very refreshing martini (gin, three olives).</p>

<p>And to complete the impromptu drift into another life, had a natter with none other than <a href="http://www.johnstoddart.co.uk">John Stoddart</a> who was having a mineral water while waiting to meet a picture agency chap up the other end of the bar...</p>
