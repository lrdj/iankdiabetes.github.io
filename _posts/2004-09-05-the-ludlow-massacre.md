<p>Well, not knowing who that bluegrassy artist was made me want to look him up. Turns out it wasn't a ukelele, and it was none other than the great <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/parton/2/ludlow.html">Woodie Guthrie</a> himself in 1944:</p>

<blockquote><p>We were so afraid you would kill our children,<br />
We dug us a cave that was seven foot deep,<br /><br />
Carried our young ones and pregnant women<br /><br />
Down inside the cave to sleep.</p></blockquote>
