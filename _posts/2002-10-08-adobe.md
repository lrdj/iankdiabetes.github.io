<p>They don't keep their software up to date in a way that is useful to the user, but I won't go there&hellip;</p>

<p>If you are an <span class="caps">OSX </span>user and need updates to Illustrator (the Pantone data that shipped with 10.0.1 was woefully inaccurate) you are now asked to register. In particular, the download sequence requires a postcode, which <span class="caps">IMHO </span>is downright cheeky as this ain't no shareware shit honey. I've shelled and shelled again (imagine my surprise when I spent hard currency on Acrobat 10 only to discover that Distiller only runs in Classic) and have also registered my copies of Adobe software. I'm sorry, this is a hustle, and it pisses me off (yes I know, I could put a fake postcode in but it's the principle of the thing)</p>

<p>So I thought I'd post the following:</p>

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/">ftp://ftp.adobe.com/</a></p>

<p>this takes you to the public ftp server at the level of application listings, follow the links to your desired update at your leisure:-) Now, let's see how long they keep public ftp going&hellip;</p>
