<p>Is it just me or did the <a href="http://www.the5k.org/list.asp">5k</a> disapoint this year? This year for the first time, most of the 'cleverer' entries don't work on my machine. The fact that these same entries are often highly rated worries me. Mebbe next year we could have a "web" category instead of the current "device dependent" category :-(</p>
