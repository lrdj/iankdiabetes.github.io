<p><img src="http://photos5.flickr.com/7059920_ace0a39d72_s.jpg" alt="what I can see in the mirror" class="left" style="float:left" /> Sitting here in <a href="http://www.muf.co.uk/"><span class="caps">MUF</span></a> where I work on personal projects thinking about the structure of a huge, museum website and have just noticed that Technorati's <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/">tags page</a> is almost 50% non-roman.</p>

<p>Aside from the huge kick I get out of modern operating systems' ability to seamlessly display non-roman characters, I'm getting into enjoying a Chinese world. <span class="caps">CLF </span>will no doubt live in a Mandarin data-universe, and by the time she's ten I'm guessing not learning a Chinese language in school will seem absurd.</p>
