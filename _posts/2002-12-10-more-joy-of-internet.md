<p>I'm curious at what point exactly when reading an otherwise perfectly sensible text (<a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/nicola.html">brief Tesla biog</a>) one notices something a little unusual...</p>

<p><q> All of this triggered past life memories I had since my childhood. I have always seen myself as a male physicist during WW II Germany - working in an underground lab with noted scientists of the day on the time travel experiments. Since age five I have always stated that I was here to do something connected to time travel and the Great Pyramid.</q></p>

<p>The domain "crystalinks" should have been a clue;-)</p>
