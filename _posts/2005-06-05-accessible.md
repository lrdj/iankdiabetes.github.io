<p>I'm always curious to hear any information that suppports the argument that not making your site accessible is a nonsense. The <a href="http://www.dda-centre.co.uk"><span class="caps">DDA</span> Centre</a> has nothing to do with website design, but they did have this little snippet on their website:</p>

<blockquote><p>Disabled people have an annual spending power of 50 billion pounds a year. There are approximately 8.6 million disabled people in Britain.<br />
<em>Source: Regulatory Impact Assessment, Access to Goods, Services and Facilities, Disability Discrimination Act, Department of Work and Pensions, July 2001</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Essentially, it is now so easy to make your website accessible, that you're just chucking customers out the window by not making the effort...</p>
