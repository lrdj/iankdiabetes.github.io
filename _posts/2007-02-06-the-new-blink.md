<p>The helping-corporates-move-towards-standards thing started for me when I did a longish contract at an insurance company and helped them embrace semantic markup and the separation of style and structure. Anyways, I've been consulting with these large corporates for a while now, and I'm pretty sure I can safely say:</p>

<p>Which really doesn't scan that well or seem that insightful really... How about:</p>

<p><em>Drag-and-drop is the new &lt;BLINK&gt;</em></p>
