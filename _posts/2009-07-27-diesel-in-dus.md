<p>A colleague just sent this image around</p>

<p>This is his description: </p>

<blockquote><p>There is an interactive installation at the local Diesel store in Dusseldorf.  You stand in front of the shop window where there is a screen (the window frame in the attached image) that displays your image. Lots of objects fall in front of you on the screen and by using gestures (pointing, punching etc) the objects explode. Interesting and odd to see an interactive demo like this in a shop window.  Worth a look - it will be there again on Friday and Saturday of this week. Find it at Kasernenstrasse 1</p></blockquote>

<p>Seemed too interesting to let disappear into the email nulvoid</p>
