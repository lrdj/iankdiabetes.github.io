<p>Attention all <span class="caps">CSS </span>boffins, you have until 15 July to post comments on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-CSS21-20050613/">working draft of <span class="caps">CSS</span> 2.1</a></p>

<p>If you're gonna bitch about the box model or query whether generated content should really have been implemented the way it was, you'll feel a lot smugger if you did your bit to keep the <span class="caps">W3C </span>on the straight and narrow by participating and getting your notes and queries in on time.</p>

<p>From the <span class="caps">W3C </span>front page:</p>

<blockquote><p>Last Call: <span class="caps">CSS</span> 2.1</p>

<p>2005-06-14: The <span class="caps">CSS</span> Working Group has published a Last Call Working Draft of Cascading Style Sheets, level 2 revision 1 (CSS 2.1). <span class="caps">CSS</span> 2.1 is derived from and is intended to replace <span class="caps">CSS2.</span> A snapshot of <span class="caps">CSS </span>language usage, the specification adds a few highly requested features, fixes errata and brings <span class="caps">CSS2 </span>in line with implementations. Comments are welcome through 15 July.</p></blockquote>
