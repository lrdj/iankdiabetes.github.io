<p>Hilda and husband came round to look at the flat (Dug and Nicki live in a groovy two-bed flat in West End Lane in London - a flat that requires some serious work that Dug was supposed to deal with but didn't) this morning and liked it. It's funny, when you deal direct with people (as opposed to estate agents) everything seems so mellow and low pressure.</p>

<p>No offense to the estate agents of the world, but it just might happen that one couple sells a flat to another without either one being stressed to death. There's a nice thought for the day...</p>
