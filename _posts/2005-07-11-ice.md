<p>Just got this in the mail from <a href="http://www.littlemax.co.uk/">Sarah</a></p>

<blockquote><p>I have been asked to pass this on, and perhaps you can do the same. <br />
  <br />
Following the disaster in London . . . </p>

<p>East Anglian Ambulance Service have launched a national "In case of Emergency ( <span class="caps">ICE </span>) " campaign with the support of Falklands war hero Simon Weston. </p>

<p>The idea is that you store the word " I C E " in your mobile phone address book, and against it enter the number of the person you would want to be contacted "In Case of Emergency". </p>

<p>In an emergency situation ambulance and hospital staff will then be able to quickly find out who your next of kin are and be able to contact them. It's so simple that everyone can do it. Please do. </p>

<p>Please will you also email this to everybody in your address book, it won't take too many 'forwards' before everybody will know about this. It really could save your life, or put a loved one's mind at rest. </p>

<p>For more than one contact name <span class="caps">ICE1, ICE2, ICE3 </span>etc.</p></blockquote>
