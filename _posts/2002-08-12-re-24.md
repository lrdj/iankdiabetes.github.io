<p><span style="color:#990000;"> &gt;<br /> &gt; (snip)<br /> &gt;<br /> &gt; But the preposterousness of the series is part of<br /> &gt; the fun... Some of it I agree goes a bit too far<br /> &gt; (that whole memory-loss thing for one) but on<br /> &gt; the whole it knows what it is and sticks with it.<br /> &gt; </span></p>

<p>To be fair, I am sort of missing the point. It's just that every time I start getting into it (enjoying the 'fun') I keep getting snapped out of it... This/05/be a disability on my part;-)</p>

<p><span style="color:#009900;"> &gt;&gt; I'm hoping Nina is the mole and that Jamie<br /> &gt;&gt; didn't kill herself but was 'helped along'<br /> &gt;&gt; by her. Guess I'll have to watch the last<br /> &gt;&gt; episode after all;-)<br /> </span> <span style="color:#990000;">&gt;<br /> &gt; If only you'd watched to the<br /> &gt; end of the episode... ;)<br /> &gt; </span></p>

<p><span class="caps">AAAAAAARRRRGGG</span>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>darn darn darn. You're messing with my head right;-)</p>
