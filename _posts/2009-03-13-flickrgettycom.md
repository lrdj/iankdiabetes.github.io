<p>Wow, I've been suggesting that institutions who depend on high-quality photography to engage their audience should collaborate with Flickr photographers (many museums have better images of their collections on Flickr than they do on their internal resources&mdash;I should say 'more colourful' or 'more resonant' that 'better' as the internal photographs serve a specific academic purpose) but I never expected the <a href="http://www.creativereview.co.uk/crblog/getty-launches-flickr-tie-in/">Getty agency to do it</a>...</p>

<p>Not sure if this is wonderful and stimulating or the first brick in a whole new wall?</p>
