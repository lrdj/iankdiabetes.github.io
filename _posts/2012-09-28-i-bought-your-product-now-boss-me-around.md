<p>Having just finished a big <span class="caps">SAP</span> UX project, I've been thinking about how large software vendors typically (I should say historically as this is beginning to change) transfer risk and pain to the end user. Here's an example:</p>

<p><img alt="badboy.png" src="/assets/i/badboy.png" width="640" foo="290"  style="" /></p>

<p><span class="caps">WTF</span>?!? Waddayamean I'm not allowed (the required extension?) to change the filename extension. It's my file, if I want to use the suffix ".pork-bellies" I can alright? The person who wrote this error message needs a lesson in user-facing software ethics!</p>
