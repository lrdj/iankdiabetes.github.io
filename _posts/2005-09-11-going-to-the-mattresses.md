Spent the whole day at <span class="caps">IKEA </span>(both Wembley <em>and</em> Edmonton) not buying a mattress.</p>

<p>The day was made bearable by imagining Michael Corleone's entourage getting bogged down in circular arguments with <span class="caps">IKEA </span>store staff as they try and find the goods so they could 'go to the mattresses'. The thought was prompted by a shop assistant saying <em>why yes, we have 21 in stock</em> and me thinking of Luca Brasi's relief:-)</p>
