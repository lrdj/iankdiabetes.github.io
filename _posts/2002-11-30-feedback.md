<p>Well, to paraphrase the old Honda ad, you meet the nicest people at <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Zeldman</a>&mdash;ever since J published my article on <span class="caps">CSS </span>grid layouts my mailbox has been full of friendly notes congratulating or even thanking me:-) It's nice to know that others out there are struggling with the same pressures and challenges that I am. Makes me want to write another...</p>

<p>So it's just coming up to midnight on Friday, I've been taking time off this evening, half an hour of storming around the Haiti gravel circuit in my Lancer Evo Tommi Makinen edition (can't seem to beat the AI driver in the last race of the series), turning off the telly and getting stuck into the final half of Pennac's <cite>La Petite Marchande de Prose</cite> which unlike his other books takes forever to get started, but has finally buried itself deep in the surreal, confusion and wonder I am used to from him.</p>

<p>We're off to see the family for thanksgiving diner tomorrow, bringing the carry-cot for <span class="caps">CLF </span>to bunk out in. Ruth, my mother, was recently in hospital with a heart murmur. She of course decided not to tell anyone up front, I indend to get as much info as possible out of her tomorrow evening.</p>
