<p>When I first moved to New York when I was nineteen (eighteen?) and was homesick I would sit in a restaurant and close my eyes and try to conjure up the clattering sound of a Paris restaurant in full flight. There's a particular kind of rumble, punctuated by the shouts of the waiters trying to get a coffee started or get the people waiting for a table to make some room for the food to through from the kitchen.</p>

<p>Last night I finished a long day in Issy-les-Moulineaux and shuffled over to what has become my regular couscous and found I couldn't get in for people:-) The food is great, so well worth the twenty-minute wait. If you fancy it, <em>Chez Omar</em> is:</p>

<p>Adresse: 47, rue de Bretagne / 75003 Paris<br />
M&eacute;tro: Arts et M&eacute;tiers<br />
T&eacute;l: 01 42 72 36 26</p>

<blockquote><p>p.s. <br />
I did a quick search online to get the address of the place and there are a surprisingly large number of negative reviews. The balance of opinion seems to be that the couscous is ok, the wine is terrible and the service intermittent at best. I guess I've been living in London so long my food-criticism skills have lost their edge. Still, if you're in the 3eme I would say have a go...</p></blockquote>

Clémentine, je fais ces petites videos pour toi et là, je t'expliquais où j'étais sauf qu'avec tout ce boucan on m'entend pas. Je te disais bonne nuit et à demain--je reviens ce soir:-)</p></blockquote>
