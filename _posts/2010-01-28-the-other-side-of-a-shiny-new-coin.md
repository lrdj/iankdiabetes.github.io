<p>The <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> has been running the <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/">defectivebydesign.org</a> campaign for a number of years now, so it's no surprise they set up a protest camp outside the Yerba Buena centre yesterday. </p>

<p>The group set up what it labeled <em>"Apple Restriction Zones" along the approaches to the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco, informing journalists of the rights they would have to give up to Apple before proceeding inside.</em></p>

<p>That said, they're still spot on and we should all be asking manufacturers to respect our fair-use rights under existing copyright law. The <span class="caps">FSF </span>put it like this in their newsletter this morning:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="caps">DRM </span>is used by Apple to restrict users' freedom in a variety of ways,<br />
including blocking installation of software that comes from anywhere<br />
except the official Application Store, and regulating every use of<br />
movies downloaded from iTunes. Apple furthermore claims that<br />
circumventing these restrictions is a criminal offense, even for<br />
purposes that are permitted by copyright law.</p>

<p>Organizing the protest, Free Software Foundation (FSF) operations<br />
manager John Sullivan said, "Our Defective by Design campaign has a<br />
successful history of targeting Apple over its <span class="caps">DRM </span>policies. We<br />
organized actions and protests targeting iTunes music <span class="caps">DRM </span>outside Apple<br />
stores, and under the pressure Steve Jobs dropped <span class="caps">DRM </span>on music. We're<br />
here today to send the same message about the other restrictions Apple<br />
is imposing on software, ebooks, and movies. If Jobs and Apple are<br />
actually committed to creativity, freedom, and individuality, they<br />
should prove it by eliminating the restrictions that make creativity and<br />
freedom illegal."</p></blockquote>

<p>The group is asking citizens to sign a petition calling on Steve Jobs to<br />
remove <span class="caps">DRM </span>from Apple devices. The petition can be found at:<br />

<p>I'm signing it and I hope you will too.</p>
