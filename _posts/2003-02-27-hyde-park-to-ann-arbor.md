<p>Great series of <a href="http://www.hyperreal.org/~dana/">pictures</a> from the peace marches all around the world. Nick and I were standing about 1cm North East of the bright yellow truck to the left of the picture (it was impossible to get into the moshpit with <span class="caps">CLF'</span>s pram). I mention this because on the day it was impossible to get a sense for the numbers. This is one seriously large crowd. (thanks <a href="http://www.caterina.net">Caterina</a>)</p>
