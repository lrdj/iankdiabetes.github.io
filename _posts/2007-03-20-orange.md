<p>Recently, I've been working as part of the Orange group design and usability team. It's been quite interesting as I'm involved with teams who are busy developing the offerings well into the future.</p>

<p>Today I'm in Paris at a their future thinking conference. Should be very interesting. Confidential, but interesting. Ever since seeing that <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5662923972269828773">Cory Doctorow video</a> on the theme of self-determination I've been seeing the mobile network operators I work with in a whole different light, as custodians of some really important stuff.</p>
