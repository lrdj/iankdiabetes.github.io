I was merrily on my way to <a href="http://www.ica.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=14893">an event</a> at the <a href="http://www.ica.org.uk/"><span class="caps">ICA</span></a> this morning when this large wooden spaceship crashed out of the sky and gouged its way deep into the tarmac of Regent Street.</p>

<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>not really, but darn I should watch the news. Large chunks of the West End were completely roped off this morning with all parking bays supended etc. Apparently there's gonna be a huge metal elephant-robot tromping around London over the week-end. Sounds fun but I'll be tromping around the South Downs with Billy. Will try and take some pictures:-) </p>

<p>Actually, I've just been sent a sexy new cameraphone from LG so might have some news to add re mobbloging stuff (first step is to instal <a href="http://www.shozu.com">shozu</a>)...</p>
