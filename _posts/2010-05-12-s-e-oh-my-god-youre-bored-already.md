<p>Hi all, </p>

<p>This is the first post for me on here. I thought it might be useful to give a little guide on <span class="caps">SEO</span>/Content etc as I know all you designers are chomping at the bit to learn more about it. However, rather than bore you with technical <span class="caps">SEO </span>stuff, you might enjoy checking out Matt Cutt's blog:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/">mattcutts.com</a></p>

<p>He is a really cool guy who blogs on all things technology and he is head of Google's Webspam Team. Some really interesting reads on his site and also good for beefing up on the latest Google/SEO trends too if you are interested in that at all?</p>

<p>Chris</p>
