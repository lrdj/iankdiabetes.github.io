<p>Sunday afternoon and my eyes are still going mental. This is beginning to worry me slightly, after all I rely quite heavily on my eyes to do my job. If things haven't improved by tomorrow morning, I think I'll go see the <em>it'll be better in a day or two</em> doc again.</p>

<p>Funny thinking about eyesight--I spend a lot of time at work explaining (<em>cajoling, beating, schmoozing, bribing...</em>) to corporates why they need to support blind and partially-sighted customers. If I was to lose my sight, could I still consult on accessibility issues? I guess my deliverable would change somewhat, currently I focus on the delivery end of things, that is, how do you have to structure and train your delivery teams to make sure your groovy design work stays as accessible as possible without loosing the graphic 'edge'.</p>

<p>I'm guessing I could retrain and spend time doing research for the <a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk"><span class="caps">RNIB</span></a> or similar. Anyhow, it's comforting to know that the mad mad world of bloggers is actually quite easy for a blind person to participate in :-)</p>
