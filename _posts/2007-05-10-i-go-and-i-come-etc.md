<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>so could someone be real nice and do some explaining re the translation of <em>Je t'aime, moi non plus</em> in the Karen Elson/Cat Power version on <a title="Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited - Biographie" href="http://monsieurgainsbourg.artistes.universalmusic.fr/uk/02monsieur_gainsbourg_revisited.php">Mr. Gainsbourg revisited</a></p>

<p>Specifically, I need an assessment of the slider position between irony and sloppy. Or, in other words, is the translation brilliant as it <em>literally</em> (almost) follows the original text which introduces both quirkiness and humor (and has the phrasing benefit of of having Elson pause on "come")? </p>

<p>Is "I retain myself" from both Power and Elson's mouth sort of extremely kinky which is of course in keeping with the original...</p>

<p>...or is it crap?</p>

<p>I'm sending myself back to irony school because I love the track and love the crappy translation, but as I'm always the last one to get the joke around here i thought I'd better check;-)</p>
