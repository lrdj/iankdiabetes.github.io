<p>A search on Jiwire for <em>Teatro Greco, Taormina, Italy</em> reveals that <a href="http://www.jiwire.com/search-wifi-hotspots.htm?command=&amp;ssid=&amp;hotspot_name=&amp;location_type_id=0&amp;technology_id=0&amp;provider_id=0&amp;pay_free=both&amp;address=&amp;country_id=107&amp;city=taormina&amp;radius=5.0&amp;state_id=0&amp;zip=">there are five <span class="caps">WIFI </span>hotspots</a> in town, and that the closest one to the amphitheatre is at the Grand Hotel Timeo &amp; Villa Flora which is actually on <em>Via Teatro Greco</em> so presumably very close to the Theatre itself.</p>

<p>Discounting the fact that the Centrino advertising seems to be suggesting that a PC with a Centrino chip is ready to access <span class="caps">WIFI </span>hotspots--that the 802.11 hardware is somehow <em>built into</em> (included with) the chip, which of course it isn't--and that it also suggests that you can use a laptop outside--which we all know to be untrue ever since we all tried to take our 1400 Powerbooks to the beach in emulation of Sandra Bullock's character in <em>The Net</em>, I thought I'd get the wireless access info from the horse's mouth and asked customer support at the <span class="caps">WIFI </span>access point nearest the Teatro Greco if it would be possible for me to send emails or connect to the internet while actually in the Teatro (like in the ad)...</p>
