<p>Love Hockney's dances with technology and commerce... Don't know if any of you have played with the <a href="http://bighugelabs.com/hockney.php">Hockneyizer application</a> (loads of fun) which is based on his work with the <span class="caps">SX70</span> Polaroid format in the 1970's (this example is <span class="caps">CLF, </span>my daughter).</p>

<p><a href="http://donkeyontheedge.com/assets_c/2010/05/hockney_CLF-19.html" onclick="window.open('http://donkeyontheedge.com/assets_c/2010/05/hockney_CLF-19.html','popup','width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://donkeyontheedge.com/assets_c/2010/05/hockney_CLF-thumb-520x390-19.jpg" width="520" height="390" alt="hockney_CLF.jpg"  style="" /></a></p>

<p>The link that Kevin posted earlier today had some interesing pics of DH working on an iPad. I'm not sure how I feel about his work but I can't help breaking a smile at the watermarks on his pics...</p>

<p>...a very 2010 approach to commerce:-)</p>
