<p>I had an idea to increase promotional aspects of the sites.</p>

<p>We could set up a <span class="caps">COP </span>for each staff member with a short into introducing their Christmas Wish list. <br />
Allow each staff member to add any products they wish to their page.<br />
Allow them to promote it anyway they wish; Facebook, Twitter, Word of mouth.</p>

<p>The winner is the staff member who can promote and make the most money through the site.</p>
