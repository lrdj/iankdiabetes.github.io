<p><strong>Pharmacist:</strong> <br />
Have you renewed that prescription, do you know how to do that?</p>

<p><strong>Pensioner:</strong> <br />
Of course dear, I did it <em>online</em></p>

<p>This has got to be a trend. Closer to home, Nicki's mother Margaret bought herself an iPad at Christmas. It's her first computing device and she loves it:-)</p>
