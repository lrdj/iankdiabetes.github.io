<p>You know how you get those dvds with your Sunday paper and then they collect on the shelf? Well, my family got me an iPod for my birthday in January and I've discovered how fabulous it is to integrate films (here <a title="Himmel über Berlin, Der (1987)" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093191/">Himmel über Berlin, Der (1987)</a>) with iTunes.</p>

<p>The screen is tiny but the headphones give you the cinema experience. Another benefit I hadn't figured on is being able to freeze frame and shuffle forward and back. Not sure why I think that's so cool but really enjoying doing it:-)</p>
