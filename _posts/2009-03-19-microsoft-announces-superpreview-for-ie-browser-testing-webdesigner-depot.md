<p>So I maintain a pile of Windows disk images to test sites in the nastiest of environments. Ever since we switched to targeting standards, I no longer need to test in every permutation of OS and browser but I do feel better with a good look at XP/IE6, XP/IE7 and Vista combos. You can add the extra fun of matching the four-hundred Vista OS sub-versions (MS amazes me, who, but who, thought that <strong>that</strong> would be a good commercial idea. I do wonder how MS manages to be the world's most successful business--but I digress) and you end up with quite a hefty VM library.</p>

<p>So enter stage left <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/03/microsoft-announces-superpreview-for-ie-browser-testing/">superpreview</a> which looks to let test away to your heart's content in a single environment. V promising indeed, and it's from the man:-)</p>
