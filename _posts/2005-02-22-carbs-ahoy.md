<p>Just had my first roast potato in I don't know how long.</p>

<p>I woke up at four this morning and couldn't get back to sleep. I've got a fairly intrusive cold and managed to leave the house without eating breakfast. Oh, and I managed to forget my wallet.</p>

<p>Ok, I guess I was feeling sorry for myself.</p>

<p>Oh, and I had rhubarb crumble and custard.</p>

<p>And an expresso.</p>

<p>(For those not familiar with the church of Atkins' dictates, all the above are big no-nos...)</p>
