<p>has been in the house for a week now. She now sleeps in her carry-cot during the day and in bed with Nick and I at night. In between, she is learning to poo and fart at the same time while having her nappy changed, and likes to engage in nipple battering with her mummy. Breast feeding is going well (sez he with no milk) but <span class="caps">CLF </span>has a funny thing about Nick's right breast (which personally, I've always found very acceptable) whereby she needs to have a little argybargy with the nipple before latching onto it for her dinner.</p>

<p>Her cord-stump fell off on Saturday which was exciting, but her belly button seems so thin ? it's like you could poke your finger into her tummy, which is a little weird...</p>

<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to thank London-based Evel Knievel <a href="http://www.dave-smith.co.uk/">Dave Smith</a> for his wishes, and wish him well through the next round of physio, x-rays and general physical pain and suffering &mdash; this is a man who knows about epidurals :-)</p>
