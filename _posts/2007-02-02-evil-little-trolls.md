<p>Well, <a title="russell davies: bugger" href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2007/02/bugger.html">Russell's</a> just been hit by his first evil little troll.</p>

<p>I suggested he post the links to the swine so we'll see what happens.</p>

<p>I was reminded on my own Troll, a nasty man (who, well, yes, nonetheless made some very good points but just not in a full-size-human kind of way...) called Andrew MacLaren who left a comment which had me floored for a week or two.</p>

<p>I posted <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/design_and_usability/pissedoff_reader.html">the full text</a> at the time but I'm not sure if that helped. Here's a taster:</p>

<blockquote><p>...by some unfortunate deep linking i somehow landed at your 'website', having spent a few miserable minutes reading your mostly uninspiring and often self-rightous (pap) posts, it would appear to me that in many ways you come across as a borderline wanker, and although that may seem harsh i've just had another look and to put at nicely its a bag of shite! and from what i can gather this is what you actually do!??</p></blockquote>

<p>Anyway, not going anywhere in particular with this, just felt like pinging some support to Russell.</p>
