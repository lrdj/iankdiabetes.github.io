<p>ME: Thanks, this looks good. Could you please send your spreadsheet document as a delimited text file as I can't open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">opendocument</a> files...</p>

<p><span class="caps">THEM</span>: Sure, attached. Have <span class="caps">PDF'</span>d it too, I think that it is probably easier to read in that format.</p>

<p>(I really need to investigate <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Open Office</a> but I couldn't help getting a chuckle out of that exchange)</p>
