<p>Awesome mathematically-named jewelry. You know, I haven't used the lens-flare filter in photoshop in almost ten years but I thought in this instance I'd treat myself;-)  Mathematics is linked to from the San Fran <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/streetwars" rel="tag">streetwars</a> site, btw.</p>

<p>And speaking of <a href="http://www.streetwars.net">streetwars</a> I've just noticed (sorry--rambling a bit here--bear with me...) a post on <a href="http://www.digitalcatharsis.co.uk/?p=19">digitalcatharsis</a> expressing concern about the Streetwars event currently underway in London. He makes some good points about the likely interaction between the transport system, the security forces and a bunch of sandal-wearing geeks armed with water pistols. His point is of course we're looking at another <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4478188.stm">Menezes</a> killing and in many ways I agree.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I think the game is incredibly liberating. I hate myself for not taking pictures of <span class="caps">CLF </span>in the bath. I love her, I think she's beautiful and I want to have photographs of her in my family album but I don't take the pictures (whether consciously or not) because of the whole pedophile thing. Increasingly, we are self-censoring and self-restricting. We're reducing the richness and depth of our lives because of some sort of media-generated awareness. I think it's fantastic San Francisco is filled with twenty-somethings dressed in black shooting each other with water pistols. It's especially encouraging to see Americans, who totally over-reacted to being bombed reclaiming their freedom like this.</p>

<p>Until very recently, the UK has had quite a measured response to terrorist attacks on its own soil (beautifully exemplified by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bozo/27551134/in/set-623552/">this policeman's</a> request for members of the public to move) but with crazy anti-terror legislation on the books it might be time for us to reclaim the streets too.</p>
