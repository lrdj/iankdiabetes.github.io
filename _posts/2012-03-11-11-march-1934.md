<p>The more time passes, the more I want to recall on an emotional level the memories and dreams and things I fell in love with over many years. I wanted to remember <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bozo/sets/72157623381777119/">Ruth</a> on her birthday with a tiny fragment of a passion I've had since as far back as I can remember. This is Eddie Lawson on the <a href="http://www.moriwaki.co.jp/global/about/04_01.html">Moriwaki</a> <a href="http://www.moriwaki.co.jp/global/about/04_01.html">Monster <span class="caps">Z1000</span></a> at Daytona. This may be later promo footage for Kawasaki--they did a bunch of recorded speed tests at Daytona and this may be from one of them. If so, that would make this bike a <span class="caps">KZ1000J.</span></p>
