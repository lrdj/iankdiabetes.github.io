<p>I was just about to shutdown and head hamewards when I noticed <a href="http://www.creativereview.co.uk/crblog/kern-for-fun-on-your-phone/">this fab iPhone app</a>, a game by designers for designers. Don't know if the game is any good but I loved this comment from <a href="http://www.craigyt.co.uk/">Craig Thomas</a></p>

<p>Is there an App that informs you when you've crossed the work / life threshold? Perhaps it could detect games like this and automatically suggest suitable punishments.</p>
