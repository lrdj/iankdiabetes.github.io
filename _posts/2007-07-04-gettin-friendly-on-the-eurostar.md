<p>So you know how us whitey westerners travel in the tight confines of buses trains and tubes? You know how the position of a foot or a leg, the degree of but-brush and so on can really make a difference in the personal-space stakes?</p>

<p>Well, I had a first on Wednesday's eurostar, a women drooled on me;-) We were sittin there all prim and propper, each trying to pretend the other didn't exist until I felt her go all loose and flop over...</p>

<p>No biggie of course, it's just I was a little surprised, I've had a jillion guys spilling into my personal space, mostly by accident but also by dogged territorial nastiness, but it's never happened with a woman.</p>
