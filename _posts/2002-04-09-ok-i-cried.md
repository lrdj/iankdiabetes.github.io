<p>It's the pipes - does it every time, there's just something about the sound of a piped lament... I'm glad the Queen mum's funeral service was well attended. Intellectually, I think the monarchy doesn't have a leg to stand on, but emotionally, I can't help appreciating the role they play in bringing us together as a nation. I wish we could find a better thing to define us, perhaps by our values? But until we are able to unite under some superior secular (Roddenberrian?) system, Brenda and her brood will do nicely :-) </p>

<p>She died on Saturday while I was in the car with Ben on the way to Wales (listening to cd's). I was in a pub fro hours on Saturday, Sunday and Monday night and nobody mentioned a thing - weird no? Anyway, it all worked out in the end.</p>
