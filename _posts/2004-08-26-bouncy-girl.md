<p>What does a little girl who has just had a three-and-a-half-hour antihistamine-induced nap do when she wakes up? (alt-click to <a href="/mm/bounce.mp4">download vidjo</a>)</p>

<p>What a day. </p>

<p>I'm not normally so hyper, I think I've been affected by the <span class="caps">BBC1 </span><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_3556000/3556604.stm">Nurseries Under Cover</a> programme (broadcast on 12 August). It really did reinforce all a parent's most primary fears. In one incident, a child is given food he is alergic to. As his condition rapidly detereorates, the staff are seen handling him and pointlessly fussing. No staff member thinks of dialling 999 and none was equipped (or aware enough) to keep oxygenating the child's blood with <span class="caps">CPR </span>long enough to get him to hospital. The nursery staff call the child's mother and wait for her to collect her nearly dead baby.</p>

<p>In a gut-wrenching (reconstructed) scene, the mother is left to rush her child to the local <span class="caps">GP'</span>s office. The tiny chance of survival the kid had was whitheld from him by the nursery staff. He died.</p>
