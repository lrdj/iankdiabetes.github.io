<p>Well, <span class="caps">GPRS </span>seems to be missing in Germany, so I'll post this whenever I get network.</p>

<p>Crossed the Rhine on a small bridge north of Strasbourg. I had forgotten exactly how huge it is, that is one major waterway. It's kind of funny, I moved to France before the common market happened and it still gives me a strange feeling to go driving across borders with no check. Particularly bridges on the Rhine.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning off to Italy, but for now I have two very large and not particularly nice sausages to digest along with two pints of warm pilsener...</p>

<p>Drove through France today, even with air-con I had to stop for air every 30 minutes, at one point the dial read 107 Fahrenheit!</p>

<p>Hopefully, there'll be water in the pool and no forest fires when I get to Tuscany</p>
