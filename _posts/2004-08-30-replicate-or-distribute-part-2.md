<p>Bonusprint, the <span class="caps">UK'</span>s leading mail order photo processor, will be launching in November with a Cognima Snap powered service. The system I'm currently trialling will be available to members of the public--just head on down to Bonusprint and request the "mobile" service.</p>

<p>So far I'm very impressed.</p>

<p>The devil being in the details, I expected the installation to be clunky at best. The Cognima team have spent a lot of time getting the configuration and interface information up to date, so instead of gobbledegook, I received a well-writen <span class="caps">SMS </span>alert with precise and correct instructions on how to install the Replicate(t) client software.</p>

<p>So much so, the text had instructions for menu items I didn't even know existed (like scanning an <span class="caps">SMS </span>for a web address and then directing Opera to load that address).</p>

<p>Once installed, the client starts up and the runs as a deamon in the background (cognimad?). As far as I can tell, the software doesn't have a direct impact on battery life, OS responsiveness or Internet conectivity. </p>

<p>So far so good.</p>
