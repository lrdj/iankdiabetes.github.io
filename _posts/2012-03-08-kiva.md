<p>So it's #IWD today and I've just received an email from Kiva. I've been sending spare cash their way and investing in smallholders. The link at the bottom is designed to attract new investors. This is a process that makes sense and you should at least take a look</p>

<ul>
<li>Over 1 billion people live in extreme poverty - 75% are women and girls.</li>
<li>76 million primary school-age children are not in school - 60% are girls.</li>
<li>There are 876 million illiterate adults in the developing world - over 65% are women.</li>
<li>Women produce half the world's food, but own only 1% of the world's farmland.</li>
</ul>

<p>So go <a href="http://www.kiva.org/women">invest in a woman</a> </p>
