<p>OK one last post before bed... I've just been reviewing the impact my mucking about with the templates has had on old <span class="caps">URL</span>s and came across the old splorp post with the "powered by Newton" gif.</p>

<p>I click on the link and ta-dah! the Splorp <a href="http://newton.splorp.com:8080/">Newton server</a> is still running, still reliably serving both static and <a href="http://newton.splorp.com:8080/html/packages">dynamically generated pages</a> - not sure why that makes me so happy but it does :-)</p>
