<p>Well, it's Friday, and Nick and <span class="caps">CLF </span>have gone off to visit young Gulia, one of the nct babies. It's been quite a week, Nick's parents came down to stay with us, <span class="caps">CLF </span>discovered the fun of staying up all night and I can't seem to focus on my keyboard enought to finish anything. To top it all off, we lost to Brazil :-( Don't know why, but I was sure we were going to do well this time. I wonder if Andreas' theory linking sporting performance with national trends like <span class="caps">GDP </span>will prove to be true. If it is, we're in for a rocky ride...</p>

<p>But the sun is shining for the first time in ages, and this Sunday I'm off to see Pulp in Thetford forest with Billy, which should be a major laugh :-)</p>
