<p>I know I have absolutely no impact whatsoever on the music publishing industry, but I just wanted to confirm that if any record companies are listening, I will never buy another CD from you guys that has <a title="That CD insert loves to sleep around ›› journal › itch.in::." href="http://itch.in/journal/anothercdinsert/">copy protection</a> or other <span class="caps">DRM </span>nonsense.</p>

<p>Oh, and Steve, just so's you know, I'm not buying another track from the iTunes Music Store until until you remove the machine limitation on FairPlay or <a href="http://hymn-project.org/">JHymn</a> is fixed.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
