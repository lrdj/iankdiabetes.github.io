<p>Just came across this fantastic <a href="http://www.lnreview.co.uk/news/005167.php">open letter to the bombers</a> over at <a href="http://www.lnreview.co.uk/"><span class="caps">LNRE</span></a></p>

<blockquote><p>And that's because we're better than you. Everyone is better than you. Our city works. We rather like it. And we're going to go about our lives. We're going to take care of the lives you ruined. And then we're going to work. And we're going down the pub.</p>

<p>So you can pack up your bombs, put them in your arseholes, and get the fuck out of our city.</p></blockquote>
