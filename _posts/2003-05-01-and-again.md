<p>I seem to remember being aware of Mena's liking of Y&eacute;y&eacute;-girl music from reading <a href="http://www.dollarshort.org/">dollarshort.org</a> but had stored that information someplace hard to get to. So I decided to have a go at installing Moveable Type on my iBook as a mobile development thing, as so far I had always got an engineer to do it for me (yeah ok, ok). Figuring which httpd.conf file to edit was a bit tricky, but Ben's installation instructions are very good (two confusing bits but still, I'm so not complaining) and I had the thing up and running in an hour or so. Imaging my delight when the default username/password combo pops up as "Melody Nelson".</p>

<p>MN was a major Gainsbourg concept album and I just wanted to mention it here as the song lyrics below on their own are a bit cryptic;-)</p>

<p>Oh, and while I'm at it, Ben has asked for a translation of "&Ccedil;a Plane Pour Moi" so I'm working on that one (trying to find good seventies French slang reference is a bit difficult but I'll cobble something together...)</p>
