<p>Would you guys mind terribly debugging your frigging JS code before you slap it on your website? Please.</p>

<p>I have to run with JS error notification turned on most of the time and it&#8217;s getting increasingly difficult to browse without getting syntax error notification pop-ups. It&#8217;s not hard to do and it&#8217;s not too much to ask, so please get with the programme&#8230;</p>
