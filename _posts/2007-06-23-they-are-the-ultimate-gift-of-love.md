<p>Last year I built a <a href="http://www.janusthinking.com/">couple</a> of <a href="http://www.allieddiamonds.com/">sites</a> for a guy that I frequently collaborate with. The sites talk about diamonds, the diamond industry and luxury more generally.</p>

<p>He was wondering about <span class="caps">SEO </span>issues and to illustrate a point, I'm posting <a title="De Beers bridal diamonds. They are the ultimate gift of love." href="http://www.debeers.com/icat/topbridal">this link to De Beers diamonds</a>. We were curious why the De Beers consumer website fares so poorly in Google. I did a search on "They are the ultimate gift of love" a sentence from the introductory paragraph and the string "De Beers" appears nowhere on the first page of Google results. Weird;-)</p>

<p>Actually, not so weird as the html is pretty much not semantic even a little tiny bit. In any case, I'll check the position of this post in a few day's time and see how it compares with the corporate site.</p>
