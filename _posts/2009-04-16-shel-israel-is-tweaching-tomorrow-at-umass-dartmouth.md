<p>The unstoppable Shel Israel continues his journey of immersion and involvement through social media:</p>

<blockquote><p>What I love is this is that I get to talk with students. </p>

<p>Through their questions I get to learn what's on their mind regarding Twitter and social media. Like many people, I would love to spend more time as a guest instructor, but schools have little budget for people like me where travel costs are involved. I'm sure what we do tomorrow will have a few glitches and bumps, because as far as I know, no one has tried to guest instruct a class via Twitter before. </p>

<p>My hope though is that others watch what we do then try something like this themselves. Take what I do with 35 students at UMass Dartmouth and refine it. This may be a new way to remotely talk with people who want to learn.</p></blockquote>
