<p>Love this:-) Jason Santa Maria on <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/saying-no">saying no</a></p>

<blockquote><p>I spoke on a topic that's become very near and dear to my heart in the past few years: saying "no". It might be saying no to a project or job, or even something that you think you can't say no to, but finding the strength to set your own priorities for what you want is one of the most crucial things you can do in life.</p></blockquote>
