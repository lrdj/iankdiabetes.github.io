<p>Steve Allam is a maniac who has ported the <span class="caps">VNC </span>client to the Symbian os (P800 <a href="http://www.imhotek.com/images/vnc_screen_p800.jpg">screenshot</a>) which is both completely pointless and very very cool :-)</p>

<p>He says he's looking into a port for the Nokia 6600 in the near future, so my fingers are crossed. You can read more about the product at the <a href="http://www.imhotek.com/version3/">imhotek website</a> and if you've never played with <span class="caps">VNC, </span>you should definitely check out the <a href="http://www.realvnc.com/what.html">main support site</a></p>
