<p>Will this one not die? Once upon a time a man called <a href="http://chris.raettig.org">Chris Raettig</a> was slogging it out at a small consultancy called pumpernickle when he came across the first corp anthem (kpmg I think it was) - anyway, you all know the story by heart but James just sent me an email with this link: <a href="http://www.zdnet.co.uk/specials/2002/it-anthems/">http://www.zdnet.co.uk/specials/2002/it-anthems/</a> will they not let it lie? Ok, so now it's called "it anthems" (no, not <span class="caps">TPT, IBM</span>) instead of corporate... I jussdunno ;-)</p>
