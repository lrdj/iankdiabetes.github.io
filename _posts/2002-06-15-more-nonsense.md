<p>I've modified the generator script so that the selection of links (over there on the right) automatically extracts my bookmark file and chops out links using a seeded number. This happens every sixty minutes. "Cool" I thought, and then I realised that I don't edit this file, it just grows in a more or less free-form way.</p>

<p>So I just wanted to say that some of the links/05/well be broken and if something a bit dodgy should appear, reload the page and it might go away...</p>
