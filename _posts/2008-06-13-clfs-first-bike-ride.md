<p>Well, actually her first go on the GS was a couple of years ago in a Paddington car-park but today we got her into some jeans and strapped Nicki's old helmet on. We didn't go far as the fun-fair was only a few streets away but she kept her feet on the pegs and held on like a trouper.</p>

<p>Not something I'd want to do again before getting her a proper <span class="caps">CLF</span>-sized helmet but it's great having the other travel option available.</p>

<p>That, and her driving doggems for the first time and hopefully she's had an interesting evening:-)</p>
