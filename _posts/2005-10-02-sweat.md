<p>I've just spent the evening in a dark, smokey room in London packed with sweating, jumping crazy people punching that air in time to "I fought the law". </p>

<p>Marquee club, 23rd May 1977? </p>

<p>Nope, <a href="http://www.punkrockkaraoke.co.uk/">punk-rock karaoke</a> night upstairs at <a href="http://www.meanfiddler.com/displayPage_garage.asp?PageID=362">The Garage</a> (whose downstairs bar is apparently worth the visit even without a selection from the Undertones) and I totally recommend it--even those under 40 wil enjoy this:-)</p>

<p>For the record, I made a <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/mm/cocks.avi" title="see the shocking video footage">complete disaster</a> out of Pete Shelley's <em>What do I get?</em> And <span class="caps">YES,</span> I'd do it again:-)</p>
