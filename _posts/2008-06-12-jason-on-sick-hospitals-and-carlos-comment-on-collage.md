<p>So still no Seed notes eh? I'm struggling a bit because I filtered a lot out and on balance didn't really pick up anything practical that I wasn't doing already...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.healthyhospitals.org.uk/popups/muf_1.html"><img alt="View Anna's awesome collage" src="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/anna_sandberg_collage-thumb.jpg" width="370" height="85" /></a></p>

<p>Jason made a comment about hospitals being broken in response to <a href="http://hiddenchemistry.com/">Peter's</a> question "if you could fix anything what would it be? and earlier on in the day Carlos Segura had made a comment about only ultra-creative types using the collage medium.</p>

<p>This triggered a memory, check out this <a href="http://www.healthyhospitals.org.uk/popups/muf_1.html">awesome collage</a> by Anna Sandberg which was supporting <span class="caps">MUF'</span>s proposal to <span class="caps">CABE'</span>s <em>Healthy Hospitals</em> project.</p>

<p>The full <span class="caps">MUF </span>proposal <a title="Cabe Healthy Hospitals &amp;gt; muf architecture/art with Rosetta Life" href="http://www.healthyhospitals.org.uk/muf/muf.html">is still online</a> and is well worth a look :-)</p>
