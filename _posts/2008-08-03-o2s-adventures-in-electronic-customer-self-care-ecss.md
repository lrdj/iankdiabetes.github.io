<p><img alt="Current edge icon" src="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/edge_du_jour_03082008.gif" width="78" height="82" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 5px 0;" /><span class="caps">OK,</span> I think O2 wins this donkey's current "Edge du Jour" tag.</p>

<p>Take a look at this wizard-style information display from the O2 self-care website. I landed here as I had just invested a chunk of my free time trying to review my invoice online having received my monthly <em>your invoice is ready</em> html email. Of course I failed, and I then failed to refresh my password, and sent a few paragraphs of vitriol to the support email only to be told that O2 can only be contacted using their customer contact wizard (perversly named "email us").</p>

<p><img alt="This wizard display suggests a reluctance to engage in dialogue" src="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/ecss.gif" width="370" height="86" style="margin:1em 0 1em 0;" /></p>

<p>So before you even get started, what does this display suggest?</p>

<ol>
<li>O2 <strong>only gives customer service to customers who know their details</strong>. This could be a problem for new customers who may not yet have received all the cryptic bits of misorganised pseudo-information that O2 sends out in a bid to help new customers settle in. This might also be a problem for existing customers who are on holiday or away from their base (imagine being in an internet caf√© in Belize City trying to get help with your phone).</li>
<li>Assuming a customer has their details to hand, <strong>O2 will only engage in dialogue with users who can pass security</strong>. Now, this is a support email for crissake, what the hell kind of security do you mean? I just want to email you to complain or ask for help and you will only hear me out if I can give you secret password (which I've either forgotten or never had to begin with). This is just ridiculous</li>
<li>O2 will only listen to queries for internet users who get through steps one and two above</li>
</ol>

<p>This is bad on a number of levels but the most obvious one is that the experience design takes no account of <a href="http://www.usabilitynet.org/tools/13407stds.htm">context-of-use</a>. </p>

<p>If you are designing a support interface you can be pretty sure that most of the users who engage with it will have negative context-of-use issues. A big part of the interface's success will be taking into account why the user might feel upset or confused. Think of issues like:</p>

<ul>
<li>my phone is broken</li>
<li>there's a problem with my bill</li>
<li>I don't understand something and need help</li>
<li>I'm in unfamiliar surroundings</li>
<li>I don't have access to my own computer (with its cookies and bookmarks)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it's obvious from the entire interface that the O2 team took no account of these issues. </p>

<p>This is bad on further level. Dialog and transparency are now key elements of most sensible corporations' comms strategies. There is no point having your <span class="caps">CSR </span>team and your marketing folk writing about how open you are to dialog when your website clearly isn't.</p>

<p>Finally, the contact form has an input box which I think demonstrates the marketing team's deep understanding of the customer:</p>

<p><img alt="are you sure you have an iPhone?" src="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/doyouiphoneQ.gif" width="280" height="29" /></p>

<p>Now I'm pretty sure most iPhone customers can't tell the difference between an <span class="caps">N95, </span>an iPhone and a <span class="caps">K800</span>i. I know i certainly struggle with that one every day;-)</p>
