<p>Signing is a good thing. The principles we're trying to support:</p>

<ol>
<li>No surveillance without suspicion</li>
<li>Transparent laws, not secret laws</li>
<li>Judicial not political authorisation</li>
<li>Effective democratic oversight</li>
<li>The right to redress</li>
<li>A secure web for all</li>
</ol>
