<p>So here's a use case I thought had gone away years ago... Nicki is driving, Dug's riding shotgun and the kids are in the back. We're all trying to squeeze in a quick flooring purchase to finish Hal's room today because we need it for his cousin who is coming to stay.</p>

<p>A not-up-to-date website means we're sitting in the car park at the mall having just come out of the flooring shop that didn't have the stuff we needed.</p>

<p>We've only got a couple more hours to get this sorted so tempers are getting frayed. "Wait, I know, Ikea sells similar stuff, let's head out there. I'll check their website on my phone" says Dug. Launch Safari, google search for <span class="caps">IKEA </span>flooring...</p>

<p><img alt="Ikea webstore fail" src="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/IMG_0020.PNG" width="480" height="320"  style="border:1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>so I know it's not adobe's fault the iPhone doesn't support flash, and I know <span class="caps">IKEA'</span>s whole site isn't in flash but none of that matters to the customer. When you're designing a product you have to put the customer's context of use before any other consideration.</p>

<p>I'm the customer, I want to give money to <span class="caps">IKEA </span>and the website says "no, fuck off we don't want your business" from the customer's point of view this is just a massive #fail on everybody's part.</p>

<p>And of course in the end we did buy the flooring. Just not at <span class="caps">IKEA.</span></p>
