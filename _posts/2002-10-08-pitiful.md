<p>You know, there's nothing more pitiful than an empty cot:-( </p>

<p><span class="caps">CLF'</span>s little bed has been living next to ours&mdash;they say babies shouldn't sleep alone until they're six months old&mdash;and I've gotten used to looking over and seeing her through the bars. I'm toying with the idea of chucking work in and heading off to Scotland to be with my girls...</p>
