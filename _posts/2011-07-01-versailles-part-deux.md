<p>OK so just a quickie as I take in Today on <span class="caps">R4...</span></p>

<p>I haven't read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/01/nyregion/strauss-kahn-case-seen-as-in-jeopardy.html">the story on the <span class="caps">NYT </span>site</a> yet but by the sound of it, the maid who accused <span class="caps">DSK </span>of rape collected a bunch of cash payments from some hoods doing time in a New York jail.</p>

<p>So I get it that a hotel maid on minimum wage benefits from some extra cash. But...</p>

<ul>
<li>What benefit did the small-time crims get from the sting operation?</li>
<li>How did a bunch of dealers know to pick <span class="caps">DSK </span>or indeed what hotel he'd be staying at?</li>
<li>If the crims had no motive for the sting, who did?</li>
</ul>

<p>If was Agatha Christie I'd have to say Christine Lagarde looked like a good candidate:-)</p>

<p>Talk about intrigue...</p>
