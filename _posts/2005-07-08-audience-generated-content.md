<li>Mobile video and photography enables new type of coverage experienbce</li>

<p>The picture I'm refering to is captionned <em>"Passengers evacuate an underground train at Kings Cross (Photo: Alexander Chadwick)"</em></p>

<p><span class="caps">BBC </span>has a nice little slide show, but as ever, the <s>best</s> interesting, raw, curious (what's with all the intense Joan Crawford headhsots), moving, spontaneous, uneven and constantly growing media is on Flickr (I was watching the "The 7/7 Community (formerly London Bomb Blasts)" group pool but there are many others)</p>

<p>More on this when I can take a few minutes off work...</p>
