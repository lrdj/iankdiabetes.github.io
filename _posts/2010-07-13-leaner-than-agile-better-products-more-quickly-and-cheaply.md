A former colleague (Conversion Manager) posted this article on lean software development which might be interesting going forward. He was happy for me to share his post.<br /><br />The premise of this is to take small iterative steps in a MVT environment to really make the biggest steps forward in terms of value. Its a little different from the way things currently work which in essense is a waterfall process (Design it - Build it - Release and hope for the best).<br /><br />Its agile on acid in a nutshell :)<br /><br /><a href="http://graysontechnology.co.uk/2010/07/09/leaner-than-agile-better-products-more-quickly-and-cheaply/">Leaner than agile</a><br />
