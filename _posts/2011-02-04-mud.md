<p>How did I not know about <a href="http://frontalot.com/index.php/">frontalot</a>? The noise on the <span class="caps">MT5 </span>threads included a funny thread which includes this <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2011/01/sixapart-japan-to-be-acquired.html#comment-6a0120a57dfbcd970c0148c7dbfab7970c"><span class="caps">MUD </span>(Infocom) inspired comment</a></p>

<blockquote><p>You are standing in a typical conference room, containing a large table surrounded by chairs of varying repair. Six Apart Japan, Moveable Type and the Six Apart Brand are here. There is a platter with food of questionable provenance on the table.</p>

<p>&gt;EXAMINE <span class="caps">SIX APART BRAND</span></p>

<p>Six Apart Brand looks like it has been kicked out of its house and sleeping on friends' couches for a few months. Its eyes dart around the room nervously.</p>

<p>&gt;TAKE <span class="caps">ALL</span></p>

<p>Taken.</p>

<p>&gt;I</p>

<p>You are carrying:<br />
a mobile phone<br />
a briefcase<br />
several dozen business cards<br />
Six Apart Japan<br />
Moveable Type<br />
Six Apart Brand<br />
Questionable Food</p>

<p>&gt;REASSURE</p>

<p>What do you want to reassure?</p>

<p>&gt;SIX <span class="caps">APART BRAND</span></p>

<p>You speak soothingly and Six Apart Brand becomes noticeably calmer</p>

<p>&gt;EAT <span class="caps">FOOD</span></p>

<p>The food is satisfying at first but leaves a bad taste in your mouth, and a virus in your stomach. A mercifully short period of extreme unpleasantness follows resulting in most of your insides ending up on your outsides. Six Apart Brand whimpers and curls up in the corner.</p>

<p>*** <span class="caps">YOU HAVE DIED </span>***</p></blockquote>

<p>So the next question is <em>do I need to learn Japanese to keep using my favourite <span class="caps">CMS</span></em> Not if <span class="caps">SAKK </span>is to be believed but I guess we'll see... Mind you if they keep releasing updates at their current rate I'll learn any language it takes:-)</p>
