<p>I feel like I spend a lot of time explaining why not having a commons of arts and sciences is a bad thing that we should try an avoid. I bang on about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act">Sony Bono and Mickey Mouse</a> and the great <a href="http://store.doverpublications.com/0486236951.html#productdescription">Dover books that helped crafters and artists</a> in the 70s and I feel like I just can't frame the argument in a sufficiently compelling way. </p>

<p>I've just recently come across a couple of wonderful items. One, the <a href="http://vimeo.com/11206098">short film</a> embedded above. The other, a Guardian article penned by Richard Stallman in 2005. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2005/jun/20/comment.comment">He uses Victor Hugo to explain</a> how patenting processes can be dangerous:</p>

<blockquote><p>Here's one example of a hypothetical literary patent:</p>

<p>Claim 1: a communication process that represents, in the mind of a reader, the concept of a character who has been in jail for a long time and becomes bitter towards society and humankind.</p>

<p>Claim 2: a communication process according to claim 1, wherein said character subsequently finds moral redemption through the kindness of another.</p>

<p>Claim 3: a communication process according to claims 1 and 2, wherein said character changes his name during the story.</p>

<p>If such a patent had existed in 1862 when Les Mis√©rables was published, the novel would have infringed all three claims - all these things happened to Jean Valjean in the novel. Hugo could have been sued, and would have lost. The novel could have been prohibited - in effect, censored - by the patent holder.</p></blockquote>

<p>I went to see Stallman talk at the <span class="caps">LSE </span>in 2005 (he was clearly motoring around Europe in anticipation of the vote in the European parliament) and it was like a light-bulb moment. If you get a chance I highly recommend catching one of his talks.</p>
