<p>These words from <a href="http://www.ag8.com/">David Bausola</a> really resonate as I navigate my way around Vodafone internet services...</p>

<blockquote><p>There is very little value in using digital as a promotional tool compared to using the aesthetics of networks, manufacturing and communications for devising new markets. I'm particularly interested in temporary markets as the frailness of this form of economics  creates a stronger network of merchants, which in turn pushes invention, rather than innovation. This is what sustainability demands - frailness.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even more so as I am currently investigating temporary markets :-)</p>
