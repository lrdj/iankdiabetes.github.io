<p>Just got a ping from Greenpeace in my inbox:</p>

<blockquote><p>Greenpeace applauds Apple's decision to be the first technology company to leave the United States Chamber of Commerce over the organization's opposition to mandatory limits on greenhouse gases. Many companies in the Chamber have progressive and responsible policy positions on climate change that are diametrically opposed to that being advocated in their name by the largest lobby group in the United States</p></blockquote>

<p>Impressive, and it will indeed be interesting to see if Microsoft and <span class="caps">IBM </span>who are apparently sit on the Chamber of Commerce's Executive Board make a similar move. With the size and power of this lobbying group, this isn't just for show--there are some very real financial implications.</p>
