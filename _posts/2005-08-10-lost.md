<p>Just watched the pilot of <em>Lost</em>.</p>

<p>Well, no cliché left unturned but somehow, wonderful fun. Lots of good, old-fashioned seat-jumping moments, in your face sound-effects and a suitably Lynchian cast...</p>

<p>While the crash itself is totally absurd (the idea your fuselage would not disintegrate once the tail section had fallen off etc) there are all sorts of kinky ideas, like the idea that a jet engine would keep spinning well after the crash. The turning blades make a great background sound adding to the tension.</p>

<p>By the end of the pilot we have the whole thing set-up. Everyone's got a secret, the cast has just killed Godzilla's baby (oops) and the island they chose to crash-land onto turns out to be part of some sinister French goings-on à la secret research facility goes wrong in a Jurassic park meets Godzilla kind of way...</p>

<p>I might just have to watch next week:-)</p>
