<p>So last night, two guys show up with our new Jeep. All a bit unceremonious. I was particularly unimpressed with the fire extinguisher dumped in the boot&mdash;a token gesture that doesn't quite match up with the "fire extinguisher and glass hammer installed in the cockpit" that I had verbally agreed with the folk in Kingsbury.</p>

<p>Anyway, as I handed over the keys to the loaner, I couldn't help thinking how we had 'trashed' it. It's amazing what a couple of babies, bottles of water and muddy shoes will do to a leather interior;-)</p>

<p>And while I'm petrol-heading, the new bike is due to arrive in a couple of weeks. All very exciting (giant tank, knobbly tyres and the enduro gearbox&mdash;funfunfun) but I am chronically let down by <span class="caps">BMW.</span> They are so good at raising your expectations, and sooo crap at delivering. The last time I picked the GS up from service, the handlebars were loose (could have been nasty...) and while I was sold on an integrated lease package (BMW Select, <span class="caps">BMW</span> Insurance etc) it turns out that to get the new machine, I have to go through the credit rating process <em>again</em> and that what on the surface looks like one company under one badge is just the same old re-purposed shit from dodgy old GE Capital:-(</p>

<p>But that said, the <span class="caps">R1150GS</span>-A is just the sexiest thing, so I guess I'll get my hoop-jumping shoes on again...</p>
