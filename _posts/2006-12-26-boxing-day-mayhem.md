<p>So how did I get talked into this one;-) Family friends Christine and Michael Bland spend a large part of the year catering fabulous afairs on the pebbles of Budleigh beach (100 yards South of the nudist beach, near the gentlemen's club...). This is the first year that the Dug and Nicki branch of our little family managed to get our shit together to get out on the beach (Jed and Billy actually swam in the same freezing waters just yesterday) and I was way impressed: hot food, hot wine and a functioning Victrola!</p>
