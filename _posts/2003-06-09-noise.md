<p>Have just spent the morning hanging a twenty-thousand-dollar sound meter off the edge of a top floor balcony at the Docklands Hilton. Not exactly "fun" but definitely interesting--I was helping my mate Ben who is in town record the noise of a Eurocopter <a href="http://www.eurocopter.com/ec145/">ec145</a> (as it landed on top of the Docklands caf&eacute; society). In the end, it was surprisingly quiet, not that I'd want a heliport in my neighbourhood...</p>
