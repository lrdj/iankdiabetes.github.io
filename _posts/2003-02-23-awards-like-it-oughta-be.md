<p>Watching the <span class="caps">BAFTA </span>awards in the background while catching up on some work for Monday am, it always amazes me what good A-List attendance the show gets. The Audience was packed with Hollywood's finest and it occurred to me that this is what the Oscars ceremony used to be like.</p>

<p>Where else do you get good old-fashioned 10 minute thank you speeches? I think a guy with a headset pulls you off the stage if you go over your alloted 10 seconds of fame at the Oscars.</p>

<p>The night even ended with a <span class="caps">BAFTA</span> Fellowship to Saul Zaentz which generated a good 15 minute speech (close-ups of people looking attentive and serious during interminable thank you) ending with an inspiring condemnation of America's slide into darkness. You rock Saul;-)</p>
