<p>News for <span class="caps">CLF </span>fans and followers...</p>

<p>Thursday 3rd October <span class="caps">CLF </span>had her first 'solid' food (baby rice, which is breast milk mixed up with cooked, ground rice) and 26 September was the day she first rolled on to her front. She has been grunting and huffing a lot lately as she struggles to sit up (goes slightly pink in the face in the process). She can now roll back on to her back but hasn't quite mastered getting her arm clear. six out of ten times she rolls over onto one of her arms, gets stuck and sort of lies there grunting, although it looks like she'll be working that one out any day now:-)</p>
