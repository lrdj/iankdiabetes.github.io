<p>There is <em>no</em> way <a href="http://www.rfa.org/front/sira/">this</a> really works, is there?</p>

<p><q> ...Place the radio on the tinfoil, as shown in the picture, and use the rubber bands or string (E) to fix the radio onto the board. At this point, both antennas should be vertical to the board. The radio's antenna should be extended fully while the second antenna should be slightly lower that that of the radio's. <br /> <br /> Your system is ready to use. </q></p>
