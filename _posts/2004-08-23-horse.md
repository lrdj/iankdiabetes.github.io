<p>Just had a lovely morning in the rain with <span class="caps">CLF.</span> We were gonna do the painting thing, but then I remembered the stables at the <em>London Equestrian Center</em> (CLF liked Albert best I think--lots of fuzzy mane in the face etc) in Lullington Garth, Woodside Park (you know, near Finchley). Funny thing little girls and horses. In any case, this week is Pony Week at the <span class="caps">L.E.C. </span>and the place was packed with nine-year-old girls in very expensive leathery riding stuff so <span class="caps">CLF </span>got a major close-up display of horse grooming with all the trimmings (droppings, mud and rain).</p>

<p>After that, the trip to Tesco didn't seem that exciting really...</p>
