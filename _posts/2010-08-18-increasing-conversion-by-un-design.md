In short yes.<br /><br />This thinking goes against every tissue of my fibre, but seeing it in reality, its interesting that sites which are less design orientated have a huge following and enviable conversion rates.<br /><br />An example of this was in my previous role where an xml partner had large booking figures and looked like it had been designed by your 5 year old nephew. http://www.smoothhound.co.uk/<br /><br />Couple of article's that cover the main points:<br /><br />http://blog.kissmetrics.com/ugly-websites/<br /><br />http://conversionvoodoo.com/blog/2010/04/increase-your-conversion-rate-by-making-your-site-uglier/<br />
