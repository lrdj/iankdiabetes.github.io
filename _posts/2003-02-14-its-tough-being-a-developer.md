<p>Just got a note in the post asking me to register for the 2003 <span class="caps">ADC </span>in San Jos&eacute;, California. For the first few seconds I actually considered using up some air-miles and spending two days in the sun to catch a glimpse of Steve Jobs in action in the flesh. Then I saw the price...</p>

<p><q> WWDC 2003 E-Tickets are also available a la carte at the "Early Bird" price of US$ 1295. </q></p>

<p>This is clear proof that <del>Sadam has weapons of mass destruction</del> all software developers are millionaires. One thousand three hundred dollars to go to a trade show? And this is the cheap early bird price?</p>
