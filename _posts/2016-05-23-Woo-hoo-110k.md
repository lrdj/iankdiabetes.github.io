So I'm pretty sure I crossed over the 100 kilos threshold in high-school. I had a 36-inch waist when I was 16 years old and with a few short reversals, things sort of drifted in the wrong direction from there. Considering I had lived almost years over the 20-stone (just under 130 kilos!) mark in a million years I never thought I'd be here.

If it's any use to folk in my situation this is another great example of what's possible with a ck little perseverance and some discipline. Of course the scales and the myfitnesspal app are a key part of keeping me honest so defo recommend anyone trying the same thing do the same.
