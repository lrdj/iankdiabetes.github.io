The orthogonal curve doesn't show the detail of slow weight loss, which can be a little discouraging -- the curve on the iphone app is nicer (prob because designed for a vertical window rather than computer screen). 

In the chart you can see that over the course of this diabetes reversal thing (which according to the data [Professor Roy Taylor](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/medicalsciences/research/groups/profile/roy.taylor) presents in his reports happened ages ago -- blood glucose normal in 7 days and pancreatic fat all but gone by week 8 meaning I've been non-diabetic since the end of August!)
 )
So I'm pretty sure I crossed over the 100 kilos threshold in high-school. I had a 36-inch waist when I was 16 years old and with a few short reversals, things sort of drifted in the wrong direction from there. Considering I had lived almost years over the 20-stone (just under 130 kilos!) mark in a million years I never thought I'd be here.

If it's any use to folk in my situation this is another great example of what's possible with a ck little perseverance and some discipline. Of course the scales and the myfitnesspal app are a key part of keeping me honest so defo recommend anyone trying the same thing do the same.
