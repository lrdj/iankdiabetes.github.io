<p>So this one sounded good. I'm thinking 'power and control' sounds a lot like the mantra <em>du jour</em> "less control, greater influence". I'm thinking, crikey, they have Naomi Campbell and John Malkovich and they're doing some super-clever multilevel exploration of them (the company? the artists? the characters?) losing control and gaining influence mixed in with the 'power is nothing without control' brand message in a sort of advertising meets internet culture message mash-up...</p>

<p>But no, not really.</p>
