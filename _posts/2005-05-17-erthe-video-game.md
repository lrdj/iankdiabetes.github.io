<p>The bumpf reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>As the new intern in the <span class="caps">ER, </span>you’ve got your work cut out for you. No sleep in 36 hours and you lay down for a well-deserved rest.  Then the call comes in; there’s been a freeway pile-up with multiple victims.</p></blockquote>

<p>To be honest, I can't imagine how the gameplay can work. I mean I'm a huge fan of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/ER/">ER the television series</a> but this looks like it uses the same engine as the Sims. Not sure how all that lovely tension, pain, suffering and redemption are supposed to emanate from those goofy pattern-mapped stick-figures. Anyways, if Francis gets it together to send me a copy, I'll let you know...</p>

<p>Oh, and the other thing is that Donkey likes freebies, so keep 'em coming. I will happily review your luxury spa holiday, just get those tickets down here pronto--'comp' is my middle name.</p>

<p>And speaking of freebies, if Francis plays ball, I may have a bunch of junk on hand to give away:</p>

<blockquote><p>In anticipation of this release, Special Ops is offering copies of the game for writing reviews as well as “Doctor Bags��? for giveaway on Donkey on the Edge. These doctor bags include a copy of the game, chocolate band aids and stress cards.  This sure beats the standard giveaways we usually run.  </p></blockquote>

<p>Ah marketers, dontcha just love 'em...</p>
