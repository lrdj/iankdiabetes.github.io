<p>Once upon a time manufacturers actually manufactured stuff. This thing is amasing, it has hundreds of little parts (down to carrots and dueling pistols and a plank to walk) a crane that moves, canons and jolly roger that hide away to do sneak attacks on unsuspecting merchant vessels but it came in parts.</p>

<p>Must of taken me a good couple of hours to assemble the thing... Fun for Dad I guess but a savings on manufacturing, packaging and transportation for the folks at Duplo.</p>

<p><em>(No, assembling it wasn't going to be fun for Hal. He's five and has a sixty second attention span. He wanted to play with cannons -- <span class="caps">NOW</span> Daddy!)</em></p>
