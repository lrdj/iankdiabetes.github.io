<p>I just wanted to post a public note re the <span class="caps">ALA </span>article. I've had lots of feedback and many requests for site debugging. I just wanted to apologize to all those who wrote with <span class="caps">CSS </span>questions: I debugged the first few, but after three days worth of <span class="caps">CSS </span>debugging I had to stop. So please don't give up on your layouts, guys, and don't think I don't care&mdash;I do and the flood of mail has been fantastic. It's just I'm way too busy right now:-(</p>

<p>Also, if you're calling from a company with a <span class="caps">CSS </span>problem, please contact me through work, at pumpernickle and <a href="mailto:james@pumpernickle.net?subject=CSS%20query%20from%20donkey%20 web%20log">James</a> will book your job through the proper channels;-)</p>
