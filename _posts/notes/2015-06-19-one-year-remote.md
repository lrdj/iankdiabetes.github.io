* Shower and change your clothes frequently (or daily even)
* Your significant other (who also works from home) isn't your coworker &mdash; respect their time.
* Leave the house (even if it's to aimlessly walk around Jo-Ann Fabrics).
* Don't do house chores during work hours (because you'll never remember to fold the laundry).
* Don't do work hours during downtime (because you'll never stop working).
* Have a *special* lunch at least once a week (order out, grill a hotdog).
* Hang out with your friends.
* Ping your coworkers just to say, *Hey!*
* Build a tabletop for the treadmill and walk 5 miles every morning[^1]:
