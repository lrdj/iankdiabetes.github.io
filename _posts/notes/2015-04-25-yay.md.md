I keep a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) named `yay.md`. A secret, never shared and don't plan to, gist. It's where I keep screenshots of my personal yays.

A personal yay may be:

* When someone I admire appreciates a project that I made or worked on via Twitter, blog post, etc.[^1]
* When I was nervous or feared I did poorly, but others confirmed that I did well.
* When someone tells me something positive about myself that I needed to hear.

I look at `yay.md` when I feel nay.

A personal nay may be:

* When I'm struggling to understand something.
* When I feel inadequate.
* When I want to do everything all the time and all at once.[^2]

Unlike yays, I don't collect the nays. I find that collecting nays gives me a reason to look back when I should be looking forward. And I keep them secret because they're for me and I can add to my yay trove without fear or consequence of being a yay hog.

I highly recommend curating your own yays because looking at mine reminds me to give them out more. Here's to less nays and a karmic circle of yays.
