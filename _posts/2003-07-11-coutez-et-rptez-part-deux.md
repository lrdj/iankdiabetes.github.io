<p>Several of you requested a translation of Plastic Bertrand's "&Ccedil;a plane pour moi" (is that cedilla right?) after I <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/permalinker/?pid=6134&amp;blog=donkey">posted the lyrics</a> a few months back. Being a helpful sort of chap I said 'sure' but as is so often the case ended up never finishing the damn thing.</p>

<p>So up to the plate steps the fabulous <a href="http://www.openbrackets.com/">Gail Armstrong</a> freelance translator extraordinaire and generally nice person&hellip;</p>

<p>Thank you Gail :-)</p>

<p>(Disclaimer from Gail) <q> Howdy, <br /> I'm afraid I'm swamped these days, so I can't give you a masterpiece, just a quickie. <br /> Here she be. <br /> Gail </q></p>

<p>Wham! Bam! My cat Splash<br /> Flaked out on the bed, yacked on<br /> Drinking down all my scotch while I<br /> Dog tired, feeling ragged, pissed off<br /> Had to sleep in the gutter<br /> Where I had flash<br /> Woo woo woo woo<br /> In Technicolor.</p>

<p>Off you go! One morning<br /> This fine babe came on by<br /> Perfect doll in cellophane<br /> Hair done all Chinese a plaster<br /> Hung over drank my brew<br /> In a great big rubber cup<br /> Woo woo woo woo<br /> Like an Indian in his igloo.</p>

<p>It's going fine, it's going fine<br /> It's going fine fine fine fine fine<br /> It's going fine<br /> Woo woo woo woo<br /> It's going fine</p>

<p>Off you go! That babe what a piece!<br /> What a rush! Getting laid<br /> On the doormat<br /> Whacked, gone, emptied, slaked<br /> You are the King of the sofa!<br /> Said she as she went by<br /> Woo woo woo woo <br /> I am the King of the sofa</p>

<p>It's going fine, it's going fine<br /> It's going fine fine fine fine fine<br /> It's going fine<br /> Woo woo woo woo<br /> It's going fine</p>

<p>Off you go! Butt out mind it keep your paws off my planet<br /> It's not today<br /> That the sky is going to fall on my head<br /> And that the booze will run out<br /> Woo woo woo woo<br /> It's going fine</p>

<p>Off you go! My girl cut out<br /> Took a hike, pissed off smashed up<br /> The sink the bar I'm left alone<br /> Like a raving asshole<br /> Woo woo woo woo<br /> A total loser</p>

<p>It's going fine, it's going fine<br /> It's going fine fine fine fine fine<br /> It's going fine<br /> Woo woo woo woo<br /> It's going fine<br /> It's going fine, it's going fine<br /> It's going fine fine fine fine fine</p>

<p>Made my morning that did :-)</p>
