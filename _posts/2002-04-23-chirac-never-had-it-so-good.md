<p>What a non-starter, Chirac started running after the presidency of the Fifth Republic in the early seventies. Mitterand started his campaign in 1948 (now <i>that's</i> determination). If ever you needed a reason to vote, the French far right has set out to provide one. Considering the low level of commitment or motivation on the part of the average capitalist citizen, it's amazing that France managed to get 20% of the electorate (which is what? 35% of the population? meaning 7%) out to vote.</p>

<p>Anyway, old Jacques is going to win this election (another seven years) with the biggest margin of any man in the Fifth Republic...</p>
