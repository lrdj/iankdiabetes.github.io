<p>If anyone reading this has had a good experience with bathroom designers (that's another word for building contractor...) in London, UK please drop me an email with contact details. I've spent the day talking tub widths and my head is ready to explode. Also, the bloody prices are incredible grrrrrr :-(</p>
