<p>The corn salad (<a href="http://plants.usda.gov/cgi_bin/plant_profile.cgi?symbol=VALER2">Valerianella P. Mill.</a>) has been sitting in a seed tray for ages. I can't seem to get the darn things to move beyond this stage so potted them up in a bigger pot this morning.</p>

<p>I've been waiting for the lollo rosso letuce to get a move on as well&#8212;I think they're not getting enough sunlight, might plant them outside under a dome (a pyrex salad bowl actually)  </p>
