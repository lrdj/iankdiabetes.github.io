<p>or so the ubergeeks would have you believe. I remember Chris explaining at great length how he could upgrade parts of his Linux kernel while the machine was running.</p>

<p>What the Unix guys don't tell you, is that those amazing uptime results are helped along by a total lack of device control (no usb bus etc). When a company tries to make a use friendly version of <span class="caps">BSD </span>that is the "hub of your digital lifestyle" they bump into <span class="caps">USB </span>bus barfing and nasty driver conflicts. The following image is what happens to an Imac if it goes to sleep when tethered to a usb camera (the lovely Canon ixus) - nasty kernel panic...</p>

So the question is, who ya gonna call, Apple or canon?</p>
