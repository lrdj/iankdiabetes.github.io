<p>The accident group went belly-up today after <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/01/hi/business/2949578.stm">sacking its employees</a> by text message(?) I mention this not because it's good news--I feel for those thousands of unemployed--it's just that I find it encouraging that an ambulance-chasing outfit didn't manage to survive in Britain. AG was the first of its kind to offer 'no-win-no-fee' legal work in the <span class="caps">UK.</span> With any luck, Britons won't catch compensation fever;-)</p>
