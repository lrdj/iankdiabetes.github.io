<p>Don't keep up with my Modern Marketing feed as frequently as I should -- <a href="http://www.collaboratemarketing.com/">James</a> has always got some interesting stuff to say...</p>

<p>In December, he posted <a title="Modern Marketing - Blog by Collaborate PR &amp; Marketing: Honda's Inaccessible Dream" href="http://cherkoff.typepad.com/modernmarketing/2005/12/the_impossible_.html">Honda's Inaccessible Dream</a> a nice little flag about the W+K film (the one that starts on a <span class="caps">C50 </span>and ends up in a hot air balloon over the Victoria falls) and how while it's a fantastic epic, it doesn't let us join in. </p>

<p>He posted a few links in the <a href="#" title="a link">time</a> <a href="#" title="another link">honoured</a> <a href="#" title="and yet another link">fashion</a> (pioneered by <a href="http://www.textism.com/">Dean Allen</a>) and I just wanted to publish them here in a more accessible format:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ciao.co.uk/Honda_CR_V__Review_5003460">Its a great car</a> (this one almost feels copywritten?)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mycarsucks.com/rants/honda/2001_Honda_Civic.htm">My Honda sucks</a> (so much so he's hired a lawyer)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.2020site.org/n/common-problems-in-honda-civics.html">Common problems in Honda Civics</a> (very measured and believable)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reviewcentre.com/reviews1376.html">Lost confidence in the Honda CR-V after brake failure</a> (customer reviews)</li>
<li><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/honda/clusters/car-civic-auto/">Honda on Flickr</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So yeah, James, I totally agree with you :-)</p>
