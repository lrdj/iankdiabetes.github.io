<p>Those nice folk at <span class="caps">TMW </span><a title="TMW Ideas" href="http://tmwblogs.com/">have started to blog</a>. It's a brave step for a traditional agency and one I hope that will energise their collaborative media activities. Getting into the spirit of the thing, they have started debating in public and are <a href="http://tmwblogs.com/2006/11/digital_is_so_important_becaus.html">asking questions</a> about some of the thornier issues of the day </p>

<p>Disclosure: I helped set up the blog and occasionally post to it.</p>

<p>Also, while I'm doing the link love thing, (on the topic of social and collaborative media) you could do worse than visit <a href="http://lecturelist.org">The Lecture List</a> you'll be surprised to hear it's a list of lectures:-)</p>

<p>Anyone can post their events to the site regardless of size or funding. The service is free and entirely self-service. It's a completely open system but the content is moderated so please keep the evil horrid stuff to a minimum.</p>
