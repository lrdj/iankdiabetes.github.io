<p>For the benefit of those of us who are not diehard design nutters, the cigar tin above was created by the man who defined <span class="caps">IBM'</span>s entire visual language and created the iconic <span class="caps">IBM </span>logo. He did loads of other stuff as well (of course) but this is one of his weirder efforts.</p>

<p>This is an attempt to work the meaning native to a product experience (that in the 1950s a way of sharing the joy of a baby's arrival was to share cigars) into the product design itself. If you can park your horror at seeing a baby on a tobacco product for a second, you can appreciate the boldness and insanity of the experiment.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing about this effort is that it points to how important context of use is (in many cases I believe this is a more important and more useful tool than market segmentation). One of the reasons men shared cigars is that they were excluded from the birth itself. </p>

<p>I've compared the experience of my first child's birth with my Dad's experience of my own birth. While I was alone in the room (for two minutes) with Nicki pushing and watching the crown of <span class="caps">CLF'</span>s head showing, my Dad was alone in his car wondering what it all meant. </p>

<p>As the context of our experiences changes, so does the experience of the products and services we allow into our lives. In the future, I hope we will be working closely with others in the business to create product narratives that will allow us to work much more closely with our customers (and sell a whole load more tellies).</p>

<p>I'm just about to download the film <em><a href="http://www.objectifiedfilm.com/">Objectified</a></em> and if it's half as good as his other work <em>Helvetica</em> I expect it'll be an inspiration to anyone who makes a living out of asking people to buy stuff.</p>
