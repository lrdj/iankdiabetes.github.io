<p>Took this after a meeting in Richmond last year. The fearless deer of Richmond Park pretty much just walk up to you...</p>

<p>And what about the dynamic range of this thing? The histogram is lovely with detail and definition right into the deepest shadows. OK the highlights popped with a bit of lens-flare etc. but if you'd told me this kind of image could come from a mobile phone only a few years ago I'd have chuckled...</p>
