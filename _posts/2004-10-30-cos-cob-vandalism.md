<p>You know, my dad, Jed, has for most of his long life been a master with a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>The man can cut an elaborate 20-foot-long banner in one go without tracing the letters in pencil first (he can also draw you upside-down. I mean never mind that he <em>can</em> actually draw you, he makes an upside-down picture so if you&#8217;re sitting opposite him in a restaurant, you can see the drawing right-side-up&#8212;but I digress). He&#8217;s also handy with a knife, and as <span class="caps">CLF </span>and I made our first jack-o-lantern (spelling?) together at 05:30 this morning (thanks, <span class="caps">CLF</span>) I was reminded of a couple of lanterns Jed cut for the family home in November 1967. </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember the lanterns exactly, but I remember the feeling of horror at finding out that they had been smashed to bits by the morning. I don&#8217;t remember if Ohna was as upset, but I couldn&#8217;t figure it out&#8212;when I went to bed that night these two, enormous, intricately carved pumpkins where happily glowing away on our front steps and in the morning they were compost&#8230;</p>

<p>So anyway, I decided I&#8217;d put this lantern in the garden so <span class="caps">CLF </span>could see it peering in through the kitchen greenhouse. We lit it (rolled-up kitchen roll, large flames, lots of smoke burnt fingers because I didn&#8217;t cut the lid large enough) at around 06:30 this morning and it welcomed in the morning.</p>

<p>And there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/mm/bonjour.mp4">small video</a> for Jed and Ruth :-)</p>
