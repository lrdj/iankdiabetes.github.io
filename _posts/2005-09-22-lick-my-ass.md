<p>It's funny, I've been tidying up my iTunes library and tracking down some of the more obscure cover art. On a couple of occasions, I've come across reviews of Miss Kittin albums and amusingly, even the more metropolitan reviewers censor the lyrics slightly. Which is kind of daft really, as electroclash lyrics are pretty much verbal genitalia...</p>

<p>Salon writes of the <a href="http://misskittin.com/me/discography/releases/records/01_01.htm">First Album</a> -- link fixed June 2008, <span class="caps">MK'</span>s not a big web-standards chick;-)</p>

<blockquote><p>It contained the single "Frank Sinatra," on which HÃ©rve, backed by cheesy 1980s synths, conjured one of the more succinct images of fame and power, deadpanning, "To be famous is so nice, suck my dick, kiss my ass."</p></blockquote>

<p>It's a crazy song which I love because it reminds me of Paris discos in the late seventies. It'a long time ago and I only remember bits. I have this memory of Pliny's older sister Leslie shooting these monumentally silly films on 16mm with two gorgeous women looking very Nina Haggen-ish. Don't remember where we were, but I remember playing this one very Kittin-ish track over and over while we were shooting... Ohna showed us some 16mmm footage from college the other day--very weird but nice, wonder what Leslie's up to these days...</p>

<p>Anyhoo, here are some more of the lyrics</p>

<blockquote><p>Mother-fuckers are so nice<br />
Suck my dick, lick my ass<br />
In the mix we have sex, every night with my famous friends</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, and on the same note, foolishly bought the new Stephane Pompougnac partial album preview (<a href="http://www.soulseduction.com/common/item_detail.php?ItemID=153555">Costes 8</a>) and it sucks. Must really listen more carefully before clicking the magic iTunes button:-(</p>
