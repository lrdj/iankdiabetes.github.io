<p>If ever proof was needed of the impending world domination of widgetisation, here's a beautiful pic of Yahoo's <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-on-your-tv-2009-3">widgets-on-your-TV platform</a> apps</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/twitter-tv-big.jpg"><img alt="Twitter app on TV" src="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/assets_c/2009/03/twitter-tv-big-thumb-490x353-62.jpg" width="490" height="353"  style="" /></a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Among the first ones available: A Twitter client, made by Twitter Inc. itself. (This is interesting because Twitter has not made any apps for desktop computers or mobile devices, leaving that to third parties.) You can load live tweets while you're watching <span class="caps">TV, </span>a movie, commercials, etc.</p></blockquote>
