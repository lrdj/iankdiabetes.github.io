<p>As I mentioned earlier, James has joined the ranks of the online ranters;-)</p>

<p>He is maintaining an interesting typepad blog over at <a href="http://cherkoff.typepad.com/">http://cherkoff.typepad.com</a> where he spends time wondering about how the digital consumer is shaping what he calls <cite>Modern Marketing</cite></p>

<p>He's been writing everyday since September and by now, Google should have indexed his pages. But for some reason, the query <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22modern+marketing%22+cherkoff">"modern marketing" cherkoff</a> (the quotes around the first two words should only match the exact title of his blog) returns no results? The same query over at <a href="http://search.msn.com/pass/results.asp?RS=CHECKED&amp;FORM=MSNHM1&amp;v=1&amp;q=&amp;q=%22modern+marketing%22+cherkoff&amp;cp=1252"><span class="caps">MSN</span></a> returns the expected result.</p>

<p>So my question is, has Google stopped indexing bloggers? Do they filter out Typepad sites?</p>
