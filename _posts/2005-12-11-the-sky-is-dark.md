<p>I take 100 daft pictures a day with the <span class="caps">N70 </span>and ain't it just typical I don't have a camera on me today. </p>

<p>Nicki and I dragged our dead cooker to the dump this afternoon and I saw the sky for the first time. There's a giant column of darkness to the North East and a blanket of dark haze goes from there, over London and off to the East. At 16:00 this afternoon, it felt like the war of the worlds (or the chimney-sweep scene from mary Poppins) with eddies and swirls of foggy, hazy cloud picking up strange colours from the seting sun. Very, very weird...</p>
