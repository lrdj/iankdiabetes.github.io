<p><a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/">Billy</a> has chimed in to the <cite>24</cite> debate;-) The offshoot of this email correspondence is that I'm kicking myself for not having sat through the penultimate episode. I guess I'll just have to pay attention when the "previously, on 24" starts...</p>

<p>And another thing &mdash; digital clock countdown to 24:00:00 (midnight) so why is the time displayed in am/pm format for the "these events happen between" mmm?</p>
