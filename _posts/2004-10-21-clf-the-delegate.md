<p><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OK, </span></span>wee un is now <a href="http://www.lowercasetee.com/pix.php?state=UK">officially contributing</a> to the Kerry cause.</p>

<p>And while I&#8217;m banging on about this, there <em>are</em> things non-voting folk like disillusioned Genx-ers, lapsed Democrats and Nader voters can do to help get rid of Bush. You can <a href="http://volunteer.johnkerry.com/">volunteer</a> or <a href="https://www.democrats.org/support/kerry.html?dsc=NETA504&amp;team=2">donate</a> &#8212; I know it seems crazy sending money across the pond to support the Democratic National Committee, but the Republicans can traditionally score loads more cash, so it make sense. </p>

<p>Just for today, take that tenner you were going to send to oxfam and donnate it to the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DNC.</span></span> In the long run, this will reduce third-world misery and in the short term might make the lives of European <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NGO </span></span>employees a little safer on the ground, so I&#8217;ll bet even Oxfam would aprove.</p>
