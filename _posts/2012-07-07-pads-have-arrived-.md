<p>So the thing about Wild Bill at <a href="http://www.prodesigned.com/">Pro-Designed</a> is that when you order your <a href="http://www.prodesigned.com/details/knees_1nthird.html">pads</a> he doesn't just click a link in an erp system that ships some ready-made spandex from a factory in Guangdong. Nope, this guy actually looks at your leg measurements and creates a custom pad to fit your requirements.</p>

<p>Mine got here this morning and after three wipeouts I was muddy but unhurt. Looking forward to hills with no cars this summer and now finally ready to start learning speed-checks and 180 standing slides (I can dream).</p>

<p>In any case, so far so good and what a service! You can call Bill at +17139570341 to order or get more info.</p>

<p>Thanks Bill:-)</p>
