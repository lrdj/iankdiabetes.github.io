<p>Good opening editorial from <a href="http://www.ntk.net/"><span class="caps">NTK</span></a> &mdash; I'm hoping for a grass-roots reaction. Might be time to finally figure out how to use <a href="http://www.gnuPG.org/">gnuPG</a>. I wonder how much it would slow things down if we encrypted (almost) every that left our machines?</p>

<p><q> First, a big hello to all new listeners. Since yesterday, every <span class="caps">ISP </span>with more than 10,000 subscribers has been obliged to provide an interception capability to the government, permitting Approved Types With Non-Judicial Warrants the chance to sniff all traffic from IP addresses. </q></p>
