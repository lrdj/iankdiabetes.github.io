<p>So Nicki, at long last, has started to blog about her experiences with food. She's a professional food writer so was apprehensive at first, but it looks like <a href="http://www.bigsaucer.com">she's settling in</a> nicely:-)</p>

<p>She just returned from a <a href="http://www.bigsaucer.com/2005/10/mrs_kirkhams_tasty_lancashire_1.html">cheese tasting thing</a> in Cumbria, but her experiences include chomping on gusano de moriche (tree grubs) in Venezuela and crunching up scorpions in Beijing.</p>
