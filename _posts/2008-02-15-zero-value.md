<p><a title="PC World - Get Ready for a Crackdown on Broadband Use" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,142476-c,broadband/article.html">Get ready for a crackdown on broadband use</a></p>

<p>Man, this pisses me off. The only person who gets to decide the value of a good or service I invite into my space is me. </p>

<p>Right now, my <span class="caps">ISP </span>isn't providing me with value, not even close as my connection rarely gets over 64k (yes, k not m) and the damn connection won't come up after a router power cycle or other network crash.</p>

<p>If the service was a little closer to what was advertised I could start building my own value with it. Because I work in the internet industry, there's a really good chance my connection to the cloud allows me to create stacks of unique value. You know, just doing a quick mental calculation I'd be happy to pay my <span class="caps">ISP </span>say £40, £50, maybe even £75 a month.</p>

<p>Of course given past performance, I'd say the chances of my <span class="caps">ISP  </span>being interested in understanding how I create value are pretty much next to nil. </p>

<p>When are businesses gonna get on the damn bus?</p>
