<p>Remember the old corporate anthem, <a href="http://insight.zdnet.co.uk/business/0,39020481,2124072,00.htm"><em>Our vision of global strategy</em></a> by good old <span class="caps">KPMG</span>? It established the corporate anthems meme (it was <a href="http://chris.raettig.org/">Chris Raettig</a> who started the meme proper...) which ran and ran with <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,,615515,00.html">contributions</a> from around the world.</p>

Anyhow, imagine my surprise as I bumped into another, a truly awful <a href="http://www.messe-duesseldorf.de/md/de/wir_ueber_uns/messe_duesseldorf_song.mp3">corporate anthem</a> from German firm Messe Duesselforf (thank you <a href="http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/2006/05/messe_dusseldor.html">Adfreak</a>)</p>

<p>I guess my question is did this thing ever go away or did we just move on?</p>
