<p>Would it be a good idea to find out which of the many web pages we work on each month make money? </p>

<p>The web team spends hours, days and sometimes even weeks working on web tasks that meet the demands of marketing campaigns, yet I don't see any evidence of successes other than the DW meeting. I'm sure there are many successful campaigns every week - but do I miss an email? Am I not reading something I'm sent?</p>

<p>I think as an eye opener, being made aware of what makes money and what doesn't, I would certainly concentrate my efforts on the quick wins and less on the projects generating little return on investment.</p>

<p>These conversion reports could also help marketing prioritise how much time should be spent on such projects based on the revenue they are likely to generate.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to log web pages with Leona and get reports back on revenue generated based on hours worked?</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>
