<p>James has a piece in this week&#8217;s <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/2e65171c-2bba-11d9-970d-00000e2511c8,dwp_uuid=fcd3ba1e-2025-11d8-81c6-0820abe49a01.html">creative business</a> (sub required) and makes a few good points. </p>

<blockquote><p>In some ways Citizen&#8217;s Media is just a new version of consumer-lobbying groups. However, they are greatly more accessible, spark more passion and have instant, global reach.</p></blockquote>
