<p>Just came across this interesting <a href="http://murmursofearth.blogspot.com/2009/03/generation-why.html">point/counterpoint post</a> by Patrick Di Justo on the values of generation Y as applied to organisational structure</p>

<blockquote>
The article lists (and goes into detail on) 12 characteristics of business as usual for Gen Y:

<ol>
<li>All ideas compete on an equal footing.</li>
<li>Contribution counts for more than credentials.</li>
<li>Hierarchies are natural, not prescribed.</li>
<li>Leaders serve rather than preside.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>

<p>I'm finding it interesting because we have several schools of thought in the team I work in. Some align quite strongly with these values while others make the point Patrick makes about doctors</p>

<blockquote><p>I do not want to go to a hospital that's operated along the lines of propositions #1 and #2. It's a shame if you think this attitude describes an elite snobism, but the simple fact is that the janitor's opinion of how to treat kidney failure is not on an equal footing with a nephrologist's.</p></blockquote>

<p>I would have to agree re healthcare, but how would this apply to design?</p>
