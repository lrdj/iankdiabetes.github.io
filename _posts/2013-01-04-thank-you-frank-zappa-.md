<p>Way ahead of his time...</p>

<blockquote><p>We require a <span class="caps">LARGE </span>quantity of money and the services of a team of mega-hackers to write the software for this system.  Most of the hardware devices are, even as you read this, available as off-the-shelf items, just waiting to be plugged into each other so they can put an end to "THE <span class="caps">RECORD BUSINESS</span>" as we now know it. </p></blockquote>
