<p>Turns out the trick to building high mileages is not to hack your way through Cambridgeshire byways for miles and miles but to get some good road sections in with a good average speed. Today I <a href="http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/143737559">headed down to Regent's Park</a> as I figured the large number of <a href="http://www.biketastic.co.uk/wiggle-does-it-for-middle-aged-men-in-lycra/">mamils</a> combined with the flatter (turns out the Park look has a couple of "faux plats") road would simulate the experience of riding in a crowded charity event.</p>

<p>The good news is that I broke the 45 mile mark today. The bad news is my gears are frozen. Hope to find time for some maintenance this week as #palace2palace is happening soon.</p>
