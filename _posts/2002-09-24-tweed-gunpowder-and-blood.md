<p>Piece in the Guardian today with <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,797717,00.html">editorial commentary</a> re the countryside alliance march.</p>

<p>As I read about this ragtag bunch of tweed-wearing rebels, I am reminded of the disjointed mob marching for States' rights in the <span class="caps">USA.</span> They are similar in that they cannot express a united political position, but are clearly united in their dislike of central government. Could this be the beginning of the Unites States of Great Britain?</p>

<p>Maybe what we'll get when the dust settles is a federal Britain with urban 'city states' on the one hand, and large 'farm states' on the other. They can all vie for influence in Westminster while running most local government issues locally...</p>
