Have now lost track of how long I've been dong these shakes...

They are truly aweful. The chocolate ones have a less 'foamy' texture than the strawberry or banana ones and so are a teensy bit less disgusting. I've been experiemnting with putting less water in them to give them more 'body'

Still, this picture is on the train to Warrington, you're stuck at work and then on a train with a super-tight schedule and you don't have access to a kitchen or the time to do food prep so being able to pull a satchet out of your laptop bag is a godsend.

I sure hope this programme works because this is getting grimm:-(
