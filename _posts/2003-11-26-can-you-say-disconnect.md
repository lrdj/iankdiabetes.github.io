<p>26 November 2003,</p>

<p>Dear Jayne,</p>

<p>Thank you for your letter dated 17 November in which you reply to my letter to Cynthia Gordon dated 17 October 2003.</p>

<p>I appreciate your quoting my comments back to me and addressing each of them in turn, which was very thorough of you.</p>

<p>If I/05/be so bold, I would like to ask you why you did not address the only explicit action point contained (in the last paragraph) of my letter:</p>

<p>\t<q> Please arrange for me to talk to a sensible,\thelpful person about this matter\tand let's salvage our relationship. </q></p>

<p>If I had been in your shoes I would have at the very least replied:</p>

<p><q> Why not dial 150 on your Orange handset?" </q></p>

<p>Finally, it seems to me that your note states that I want Orange to provide telecommunications services to me free of charge.</p>

<p>As I am not a registered charity, I don't really understand what you mean by this?</p>

<p>For the record, I shall assume that you are suggesting I am either terminally misinformed, inexperienced, uneducated, naive, or just plain stupid.</p>

<p>Once again, thanks for taking the time to reply.</p>

<p>All the best, Dug Falby</p>
