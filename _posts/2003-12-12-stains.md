<p>James just handed me an FT article about the nursery chain industry.</p>

<p>Turns out the company that employs teen-agers with no formal state qualification on minimum wage to look after my daughter three days a week made 33 million pounds in sales last fiscal year. On those sales they secured a profit of 5.5 Million pounds.</p>

<p>Not sure how I feel about furthering the wage-slave industry :-(</p>

<p>I suppose at least we have a minimum wage, some of you/05/remember the last Tory government's position on it--that minimum wage would cripple business and sink the economy--nice one, Margaret.</p>

<p>Now might be a good time for Bliar to re-introduce free milk in schools.</p>

<p><span class="caps">OK,</span> I'll stop now.</p>
