<p>The Apple store has just confirmed that they are not offering an upgrade path for owners of OS X Server.</p>

<p>I bought a full version of X server when it was version 1.2 and essentially little more than a re-packaged NextStep. I then foolishly paid good money for the OS X public beta and finally spent &pound;400 on getting 10.1 Server. After almost &pound;1000 spent on unfinished software I am now at the point where I am seriously thinking of going illegal.</p>

<p>Apple, get your shit together. I'll 'happily' fork out another &pound;100 or so for an upgrade if you insist, but you're asking me to buy another full-whack license. That's just crazy.</p>

<p>So here we go: does anyone out there have a copy of 10.2 server (the cds that came with your new machine) they'd be happy to lend me? Anyone?</p>

<p>If not, I'm switching to Windows, at least they keep your expectations low.</p>
