<p>Hello List, just thought I'd spam you guys with a site I've just launched for an educational charity that lists lectures, get-togethers and happenings nationwide.</p>

<p>The idea is to increase attendance at lectures and get people something more interesting to talk about than the two or three topics they get from the week's television (though of course Buffy, Nigella, Bex and the merry band of gardeners, <span class="caps">DIY </span>experts and super-chefs will continue to amuse and amaze between bouts of archaeology).</p>

<p>If you have a friend who is struggling to get bums on seats, the <span class="caps">URI </span>to register as an organiser is http://www.lecturelist.org/register_org -- If you think this could help someone, please do pass it on.</p>

<p>Thanks :-)</p>

<p>Dug</p>
