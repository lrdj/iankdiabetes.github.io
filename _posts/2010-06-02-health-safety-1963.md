<p>Wow, Dad just sent this through, that's me and my Mom sitting in <em>Firebucket</em> Dad's MG somewhere in San Francisco (I'm guessing that's the Golgen Gate Bridge in the background).</p>

<blockquote><p>Where's the seat belt?<br />
Where's the baby-seat?<br />
Did your loving parents take these careless trips without thought of health and safety? you bet they did!<br />
Luckily we did survive didn't we:-)<br />
Love,<br />
Your Old Dad</p></blockquote>
