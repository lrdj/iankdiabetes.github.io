<p>The problem would appear to be the small issue of the <em>fraction</em> in the <em>fractional reserve system</em> or in other words, the difference between the amount of real money the US government has to hand and the amount of monopoly money created by the banking system</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.goldmoney.com/en/commentary/2003-08-11.html">goldmoney.com</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The key point of Russell's essay can be summed up in the following paragraph: "I say fantasy because the central banks are able to create money at will, with no discipline to stop them. This I believe - is immoral, even evil. The current system allows a central bank to create money out of nothing - whereas I and my fellow Americans have to work for that same money."</p>

<p>This process of creating "money out of nothing" is made possible by fractional reserve banking. As its name implies, banks keep a reserve, i.e., assets, for only part of their liabilities. For that portion for which they don't keep a reserve, they can create money (i.e., bank liabilities) out of nothing.</p></blockquote>

<p>I've been trying to catch up on the fractional-reserve system and make my own mind up where I stand on it. Tricky really as aggressive growth does look good when it works...</p>

<p>While wikipedia often fails in the accuracy stakes, its talk pages are a great window into the sides of a particular issue. The wikipedia talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Fractional-reserve_banking">on the <span class="caps">FRS</span></a> is just that.</p>
