<p>Just came across this tweet and it made me grin. I've already forgotten which particular video it was, but with Hal and <span class="caps">CLF </span>increasingly using the computer, there's got to be some kind of lesson there. Hal is often looking for Dora the Explorer videos and darn if 50% of them don't involve AKs in her backback--man people have a lot of free time...</p>

<p>So yeah, no I keep my fingers near the window-close just in case:-)</p>
