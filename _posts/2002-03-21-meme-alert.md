<p>Ok, does meme have two ems? (as in memme, not mememe) - not sure about that one. Just came a cross one of them in the making (well ok, not a meme exactly). Perhaps a new form of haiku. Apple have started shipping ipods (<a target="sausages" href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">www.apple.com/ipod/</a>) with laser engraving and the Apple online store has a facility for testing your engraving.</p>

<p>My guess is that people will start sharing these silly thumbnails (see my humble <a target="sausages" href="/i/opium.gif">first attempt</a>) online, subverting the intent of the manufacturer.</p>

<p>Not sure if this is pitiful geeky stuff or very cool... I guess if it were performed by the same people that painted their powerbook g3s electric blue, or if some manga-obsessed Japanese customer will do something interesting in Kanji I could be impressed ;-)</p>

<p>I haven't checked the Apple Japan site yet, but I like the idea of creating laser engraved Kanji ipod-art with an Apache 'plugin' like ImageMagik - kinky.</p>
