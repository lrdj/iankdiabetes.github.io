<p>Damn, I'm trying to get all these personal projects together and failing miserably. Ever since we moved Pumpernickle out of Berkeley Street, I can't seem to focus on anything for any significant length of time. The two food sites are almost finished, the design thing is close and I've got two more that I can't seem to get off the drawing board.</p>

<p>Also, Apple is being very crap about Pizmo users. About five million of us (including James and myself) had our dvd drives pack up about one week out of warantee. By process of elimination, it looks like it's an incompatibility between either the original drive firmware and some core os component (which is bad) or an Apple update to that firmware did the damage (which is worse) -- either way Apple is denying all responsibility and the guy at the end of the phone claims to know nothing of the 879 people who have posted this to the discussion list on apple's support site</p>

<p>grrrrrrr :-(</p>
