<p>University of Pennsylvania are introducing a tagging system to complement their library's traditional structure:</p>

<p><a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/06/10/penntags_when_card_catalogs_meet_tags.php">PennTags - When card catalogs meet tags. Many-to-Many</a></p>

<p>I know us advertising types don't think of library science as particularly cool, but example is relevant to what we do.</p>

<p>Put it like this: It would be like consumers collaborating with brands to design and build information architectures that are relevant to each consumer as an individual. Traditional segmentation struggles to deliver co-creation's "experience of one" and this is a nice example of how that might work in the future (make that later this afternoon).</p>
