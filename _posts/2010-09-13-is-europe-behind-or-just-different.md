<p>This from Techcrunch <a href="http://eu.techcrunch.com/2010/08/26/e-commerce-is-europe-behind-or-just-different/">on e-commerce</a></p>

<blockquote><p>When it comes to e-commerce there is a general understanding that Europe by far is not as advanced as the <span class="caps">US.</span> Sometimes you even hear that Europe is several months or even years behind. This might not actually be entirely true. Maybe a better question to ask should be: are these two big markets even comparable?</p></blockquote>
