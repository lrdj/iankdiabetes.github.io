<p>Yes siree bob it's that day again, <a href="http://www.documentfreedom.org/About">document freedom day</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Document Freedom Day (DFD) is a global day for document liberation. It will be a day of grassroots effort to educate the public about the importance of Free Document Formats and Open Standards in general.</p>

<p>Complementary to Software Freedom Day, we aim to have local teams all over the world organise events on the last Wednesday of March. 2009 is the second year that Document Freedom Day is being called for, and we are again looking for people around the world who are willing to join the effort.</p></blockquote>
