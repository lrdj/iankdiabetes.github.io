<p>Just came across a fabulous post by <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> from back in 2001.</p>

<blockquote><p>What's the moral of the story? Beware of Methodologies. They are a great way to bring everyone up to a dismal, but passable, level of performance, but at the same time, they are aggravating to more talented people who chafe at the restrictions that are placed on them.</p></blockquote>
