So I was born on a Sunday.

220 days later in August of 1963, Martin Luther King spoke at a rally in Washington (it's 50 years ago as I write this in August 2013). His speech was one that will likely go on resonating until we stop beating each other up and learn to live better togther. He said:

> "I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character"

It's an astonishing speech so just in case you haven't heard it I'm including here (let's assume YouTube is still around in a few years when you decide to read this ramble...

A year later he was <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1964/king-bio.html">awarded the Nobel prize</a> and in his acceptance said

> "I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight 
> of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality"

Overall 1963 was a year of pain and transition (maybe the end of the golden years of the 50s?). Ken Walsh wrote <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/Ken-Walshs-Washington/2013/08/29/turns-out-1963-was-not-so-dreamy-a-year">a piece</a>":  that gives that assertion some colour:

So yeah, 1963...
