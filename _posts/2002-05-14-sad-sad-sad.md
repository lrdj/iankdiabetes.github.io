<p>especially seeing as I am about to have a child, but I can't help being excited about the imminent arrival of my replacement Snell speakers (you/05/remember from an earlier post, that my original ones where damaged shortly after returning from the service centre). Seeing the old ones hurt was heart-breaking, but the new ones should be here soon.</p>

<p>The Snell site has a story about the <a href="http://www.snellacoustics.com/news.htm"><span class="caps">K.5M</span>kII</a> and any accoustigeeks can <a href="http://www.snellacoustics.com/manuals/k5sysrev.pdf">download the pdf</a> if they really want to ;-)</p>
