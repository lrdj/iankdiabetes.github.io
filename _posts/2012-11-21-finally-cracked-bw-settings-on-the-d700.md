<p>So I've been playing with the <span class="caps">D700 </span>monochrome setting. Took a while to work out the problem I was having with importing Black &amp; White images into Aperture.</p>

<p>The problem was I was working with <span class="caps">RAW </span>files which the camera helpfully doesn't modify in monochrome mode. The way the thing is set up is that the raw colour data is stored in the .NEF file, then the import mechanism allows the setting of filtration values (red filter etc) and print toning values (sepia, etc) which is great of course. But if you set the camera to save tiff only or save as <span class="caps">RAW </span>plus jpeg you get the feel of the preview image saved in a high res jpeg which is what I was after:-)</p>
