<p>First things first--<span style="color:red" cite="http://">If you're one of the many people who come here from A List Apart please read this.</span> </p>

<ul>
<li>The sample page is still linked to from ala. The page is at <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/ala.html">http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/ala.html</a></li>
<li>If you've come for the design, you'll need to wait a week or two as I migrate this beast (live and on-stage like <span class="caps">XVIII</span>th century surgery) to the new blog engine (Movable Type)</li>
<li>As part of the migration, I've decided to push the method I describe at ala a bit further, so stay tuned.</li>
<li>Once the design has changed, the original ala sample file will remain unchanged, as per the original article.</li>
</ul>
