<p>Kudos to <a href="http://specialopsmedia.com/">Special Ops Media</a> somewhere in the freeworld (5th avenue). They've just arranged for Skynet to contact me inviting me to participate in a robotic design competition. The Skynet website says it all. This is a company that wants to save the world through the benevolent application of science from primary schools to the armed forces.</p>

<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.skynetresearch.com/mobile-aerial-ground-support-mags/">small-print example</a> of their benevolent attitude:</p>

<blockquote><p>Defensive and limited offensive weapons can only be activated by the <span class="caps">MAGS </span>controller and automatically replenish themselves after engagements.  Currently in limited deployment at undisclosed locations, <span class="caps">MAGS </span>is already making the world a safer place!</p></blockquote>

<p>Because the last thing we need is autonomous gun platforms that can't walk around freely reloading themselves...</p>

<p>No, wait... where have I heard this before... Sarah, is that you?!?  </p>
