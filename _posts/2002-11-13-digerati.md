<p>Absent-mindedly pick up the Nov02 issue of wallpaper that Nicki left on my desk and start to flick...a piece about Stavanger, the town in Norway my gran came from, oh look, an interesting looking ad...it says to go to a web address...mag in left hand keyboard in right, the site pops up...yes, it's flashturbation but wow, it looks exactly the same as the print ad, mmmm.</p>

<p>How did we live before the internet;-)</p>

<p>p.s.I don't buy wallpaper, honest.</p>
