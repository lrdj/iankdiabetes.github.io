<p>Congratulations to <a href="http://scaryduck.blogspot.com/">Scary Duck</a> for taking away the Guardian <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,798749,00.html"><span class="caps">BBB</span></a>. I'm embarrassed to admit I'd not read the duck before, but in any case, there's five-hundred pounds headed for the pub:-)</p>
