<p>You know, there&#8217;s nothing I hate more than spam. So I really can&#8217;t figure out why I keep noticing the stuff and posting about it&#8230;</p>

<p>Just got this in the mail:</p>

<blockquote><p>DJ <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DIVA </span></span>appears in the house scene after 10 years of night work, serving drinks as a topless waitress and lap dancer in the best dutch establishments. At one of the clubs she gets the chance to try her skills on the decks and there she became the first female topless dj</p></blockquote>

<p>And of course the note ends on an upbeat note: <em>bookings <a href="mailto:%66%65%6D%61%6C%65%64%6A%73%40%79%61%68%6F%6F%2E%63%6F%2E%75%6B">femaledjs@yahoo.co.uk</a></em></p>
