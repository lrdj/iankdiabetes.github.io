<blockquote><p>This 'stream-of-listening' feed was provided for folk that couldn't make the event. In the end I'm not sure it's very useful, so today I'll just take notes and publish more structured thoughts after the event. </p>

<p>In terms of getting a better idea of what speakers actually said, I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.mindthis.net/">Lars Plougmann</a> and his <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/criminalintent/tags/fowalondon2007/">amazing mind maps</a> which are both complete and accurate, and are of course released on a CC licence.</p></blockquote>

<p>And that, folks, was day one of <span class="caps">FOWA</span> 2007</p>

<h2><span class="caps">DIGG </span>"crowd generated media"</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bozo/396640190/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/187/396640190_a6c35ba188_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="The Digg ecosystem" /></a></p>

<p>Kevin Rose talks about the Digg ecosystem</p>

<ul>
<li>Why should the crowd care?</li>
<li>Create incentives on every level</li>
<li>Why should people submit content</li>
<li>Why do people digg</li>
<li>Content -&gt; Diggs -&gt; Quality --&gt; <span class="caps">WOM </span>--&gt; More traffic --&gt; 3rd party site traffic --&gt; Smart Digg buttons</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we're talking about enhancing Digg (swarming the story, better fact checking, location-based opinions).</p>

<p>Benefits of Flash visualisation, could make tools to help people understand how their shifting opinions interact with others - visualisations of swarms.</p>

<p>Big announcement, support for openID<br />
(applause)</p>

<h2>Stéphane from Soocial</h2>

<p>The future of contact management</p>

<p>(does demo mmmm...)</p>

<h2>Two nice chaps talking about quotes</h2>

<p><a href="http://quotationsbook.com/">http://quotationsbook.com</a></p>

<p>Very interesting stuff, will need to pass on to a few folk who have been working with citation indexes.</p>

<h2>The spotlight section, first up, <span class="caps">BT'</span>s Stephen Stokols</h2>

<p>Converged communication online</p>

<p>Stephen promises us that the wifi cloud might be available for tomorrow (audience cheers)</p>

<p>Four online trends driving shift</p>

<ul>
<li>Lines being blurred as online cos move into telecoms space</li>
<li><span class="caps">P2P </span>proliferation (need to embrace it)</li>
<li>Advertising funds free models</li>
<li>1 to 1 voice no longer good enough - 1 to many is emerging</li>
</ul>

<p>Telcos need to embrace shifting landscape turn threats into opportunities</p>

<p>(Gordon Bennet, no cliché left unturned)</p>

<p>Shows screengrabs of BT Contact. (kind of looks like what I'm currently working on...)</p>

<p>Need to lower barrier to entry</p>

<p>Uses Flickr as an example of how to do this:</p>

<p>Talks about "interestingness" (photographs that have been interacted with more than other by analysis of log data)</p>

<p>Talks about tagging (mentions speed) the ease goes to the lowering of barriers to entry. </p>

<p>Mentions folksonomies</p>

<p>Mentions ZoneTag. Not having to remember the tag for an event (system merges cell data and other info from upcoming.com to come up with suggestion)</p>

<p>Clustering by sense</p>

<p>And now we're talking about pipes, as in Yahoo Pipes, very cool:-)</p>

<p>Pipes is sampling, not synthesizing</p>

<p>We're now asking questions...</p>

<p>Web scale computing (compete on ideas not resources)</p>

<p>Alternative resource model:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increasing uncertainty</li>
<li>Move from push to pull (socially, industrially, culturally)</li>
<li>Move to mashing up on the fly</li>

<li>Greater focus on learning and improvisation</li>
</ul>

<p>(this guy has so totally read CK Pralahad)</p>

<p>Claim and release resources dynamically</p>

<p>(points out that the pull model doesn't let VCs take such a big chunk of you)</p>

<p>Talks about "Getting Real" by Jason Friedman. Chapter 4, scalling is too hard to plan for at the start.</p>

<p><em>Don't worry about tornados and <span class="caps">SLA</span>s</em></p>

<p>Only pay for what you use</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>smugmug.com</li>

<h2>Lessons from Last.fm Matt and Anil</h2>

<p>Connect people to the music they love</p>

<p>Audio-scrobbling (listen -&gt; share -&gt; discover)</p>

<li>700k tracks streamable on last.fm</li>
<li>17M items taged</li>
<li>145K artist wikis</li>
</ul>

<p>Matt is talking about the collaborative requirements of developping a sharing application. Keeping it as open as possible, reward participation as much as possible, be realistic with finances, building engagement from your community, be transparent (downtime charts published)</p>

<p><em>...people sending us money after each server failure to encourage us to upgrade the server...</em></p>

<p>establishing an open protocol from the start got scrobbling off the ground. Before long,  loads of music players supported the protocol.</p>

<h3>Anil takes the mike to talk about growth</h3>

<p>What happens to the team? </p>

<ul>
<li>The changes when you get to 30-40 people</li>
<li>People trump processes</li>
<li>Use simple tools and adapt them</li>
</ul>

<p>Shows irc transcript from their developer channel (osmotic communication)</p>

<p>What happens to the product?</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan for going global</li>
<li>"everyone's going to want a piece of you"</li>
<li>Embed your service in others</li>
<li>Make transition from service to platform (think about your service as a platform)</li>
</ul>

<p>Liking what you've got to say Anil:-)</p>

<h3>Matt comes back</h3>

<p>Attention data<br />
<em>Scrobbling data is attention data</em> Powered by AudioScrobbler, Myware is 'spying on yourself'</p>

<p>He shows us the 'events dashboard' (gigs near me)</p>

<h3>Anil comes back to talk about monetising attention data</h3>

<p>Monetising attention</p>

<ul>
<li>Sponsored airtime</li>
<li>Personalise based on attention data</li>
<li>New attention metrics</li>
<li>No more cpm - the scrobble is the unit</li>
</ul>

<p>Dealing with tag cloud spam</p>

<ul>
<li>Censorship is not acceptable in a folksonomy</li>
<li>Attention data does not lie</li>
<li>Weigh user tags by volume of attention</li>
<li>Attention earns trust</li>
</ul>

<h3>Matt comes back to talk about what Last would like to do in the comming years.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fewer interfaces</li>

</ul>

<p>Questions session</p>

<h2>The VC bit (Danny Rimer couldn't make it)</h2>

<p>mmm...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bozo/396350951/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/182/396350951_1979f685f7_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="What is Simon Wardley interested in?" /></a></p>

<h2>Simon Wardley</h2>

<p>From hot stuff to yawn, the commoditisation of IT</p>

<p>(note that Simon says IT not <span class="caps">IS...</span>)</p>

<p>Goes through example of electricity</p>

<p>(Simon is a great speaker, he's doing crowd-pleasing things with graphics - big tag clouds with ducks and ponds)</p>

<p>Talks about yack shaving to introduce the idea behind his startup. Build what you want and pay for what you use (zimki)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bozo/396348592/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/129/396348592_de829c4e93_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Tara 'miss rogue' Hunt talks about community" /></a></p>

<h2>Tara 'miss rogue' Hunt</h2>

<p>What community is or isn't...</p>

<p>(mentions her blog)</p>

<p>What is community?</p>

<ul>
<li>co-creation leading to relationships</li>
<li>sharing profiles</li>
<li>User benefits, self policing, increased loyalty</li>
</ul>

<p>(the 'free' wifi turns out to be a solitary OpenZone base station which is currently struggling to keep up...)</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<ul>
<li>Lightweight social processes (voting, digging)</li>
<li>collaborative information structures (YouTube, Odeo, Threadless, Flickr)</li>
<li>High end collaboration - Wikipedia, open source projects (Lostpedia)</li>
</ul>

<p>Themes</p>

<ul>
<li>Sense of fun</li>
<li>Keeping the dialogue going</li>
<li>Simple platforms</li>
<li>Compelling stories</li>
<li>Rewarding community members</li>
</ul>

<p>(what is it about Wordpress that people are happy to wait for messages like "woa, only x comments a minute, slow down cowboy")</p>

<p>Compares yahoo maps to Google maps:</p>

<p>Yahoo experience totally rocks, Google maps v. empty and boring but: developers currently working with mapping apis 51% Google to only 4% Yahoo!<br />
(stats from programmableweb)</p>

<p>Fostering your own - fertile ground</p>

<p>What is sense of community?</p>

<ul>
<li>Feelings of membership (inside the boundaries, do I belong here?)</li>
<li>Feelings of influence (voice heard, learning from the group, feedback)</li>
<li>Integration and fulfilment of needs (shared values, the feeling of being supported by others)</li>
<li>Maslow</li>
</ul>

<p>Be patient! community takes time</p>

<h2>Edwin Aoki</h2>

<p>Web-based email leading driver of page views</p>

<p>Dissagregation and syndication</p>

<p>(Dug is beginning to daydream about bacon sarnies and a steamy latte...)</p>

<p>Edwin says "drag and drop" arrrrg!!!</p>

<p>Interesting slide about the developer's responsibility to society.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tools must be safe, effective and neutral (v. relevant to the work I'm doing now). </li>
<li>With great power comes great responsibility. For instance, it's our responsability to ensure that the default behaviour of the systems we build is the right behaviour, the safe behaviour</li>
</ul>

<p>(and break...)</p>

<h2>Mike Arrington</h2>

<p>On YouTube: 1 Million dollars a month but it didn't burn because it provides an <span class="caps">IPTV </span>service (as opposed to user-generated content).</p>

<p><span class="caps">AMIE</span> St. first self-regulated music market.</p>

<p>Buzz Factor - Solve a problem.</p>

<p>Mike is talking about what makes a successful startup (and what to look for in a failing one. One point is: don't raise too much money).</p>

<p>Offline/Online = Apollo. If you don't use it, you're wasting money. Apollo looks to bridge the overhead of bridging the file system and the cloud.</p>

<p>And we've stopped for questions...</p>
