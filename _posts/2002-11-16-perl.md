<p>Have just read that ram speeds are increasing more slowly than processor, bus and disk speeds. The implication is that apps built to use ram (like Perl) will begin to loose favour.</p>

<p>This I find quite distressing as i like Perl (not that i can actually programme in it) or more specifically, I like what it does. So Nick and I are off to Baker and Spice to buy a delicious pie for dinner tonight.</p>

<p>Oh, and i just took a lovely shot of <span class="caps">CLF </span>in her bath, but because i have no computer, it'll have to wait a wee while before hitting the scrapbook</p>
