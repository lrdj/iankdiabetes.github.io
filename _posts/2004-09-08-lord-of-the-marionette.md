<p>Been listening to a lot of <a href="http://www.djtiga.com">Tiga</a> recently. Following a link got me to these sensational <a href="http://www.lordofthemarionette.com/gifs.html">puppet shows</a> over iChat:-)</p>

<p>The Lord explains:</p>

<blockquote><p>Of late, I've teamed up with a talented Canadian puppeteer named Chris Godziak to do avant garde puppet shows over ichat to complete strangers. There's something strangely satisfying about the whole thing&#8230; I plan on documenting it all, so it will hopefully flower into a finished piece before too long.</p></blockquote>
