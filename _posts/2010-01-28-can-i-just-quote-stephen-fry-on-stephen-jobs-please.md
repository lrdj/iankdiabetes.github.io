<p>Everyone is quoting the really great stuff from <a href="http://Fryhttp://interestingsnippets.tumblr.com/post/358712791/like-the-first-iphone-ipad-1-0-is-a-john-the">Stephen</a> on the importance and likely reach of the iPad but after following Lynetter's link I was struck by a different part of <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/2010/01/28/ipad-about/">Fry's text</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Today had special resonance. In front of his family, friends and close colleagues stood the man who founded Apple, was fired from Apple and came back to lead Apple to a greatness, reach and influence that no one on earth imagined. But a year ago, it is now clear, there was a very strong possibility that Steve Jobs would not live to see 2010 and the birth of his newest baby.</p></blockquote>

<p>That's from a blog post, not a chick-flick. Sitting in the library here at lunch I actually felt the tears coming...</p>
