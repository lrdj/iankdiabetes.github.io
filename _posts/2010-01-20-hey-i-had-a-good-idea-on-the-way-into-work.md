<p>I forget who said the that <em>the best way to have great ideas is to have many ideas</em> but I can tell you, I'm not particularly stupid but I can remember most of the great ideas I've had--they just don't come knocking that often:-)</p>

<p>So yeah, had a really good one on the ride into work today and thought I'd share my energised status but ooops, it's failwhale time again over at twitter so I thought I'd be a bit retro and blog it instead...</p>
