<p>Give to get:</p>

<blockquote><p>The system does not promote Orange's text or phone packages at all. In fact, there is not a sales aspect to this interactive. It doesn't show devices, nor does it line up tariffs or offers in any way. You would have to go into the store during opening hours to access these. What the window does offer the passer- by is a fun experience, with free content and information services that may be of interest (eg. <span class="caps">ITN </span>news feeds, film clips, music videos etc).</p></blockquote>
