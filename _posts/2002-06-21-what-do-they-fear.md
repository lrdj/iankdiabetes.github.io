<p>What is it with everyone these days, first <a href="http://www.kpmg.com/"><span class="caps">KPMG</span></a> hassles Chris for linking to them and now <a href="http://www.npr.org/"><span class="caps">NPR</span></a> (no, that's the <span class="caps">NRA </span>- the <span class="caps">NPR </span>is the well-meaning public braodcasting lot) are demanding that people complete <a href="http://www.npr.org/about/linking_form.html">a form</a> to request the permission to link to them. How can we have a hypertext-based medium without the hypertext?</p>

<p>We are rapidly heading towards a two-tier internet. Luckily, the one with the all the money is generally less interesting (except when they're being outrageous). This sort of thing brings out the student lurking inside ;-)</p>
