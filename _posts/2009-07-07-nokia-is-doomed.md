<p>They <strong>do</strong> go on to qualify that remark but somebody needs to make some tough decisions at Nokia. Point a gun at my head and give me 15 seconds to come up with a plan and I would have to say the solution is to go deeper and narrower by reducing the number of handsets and associating them more clearly with wider types of experience as opposed to the narrower marketing segments they currently appear to focus on...</p>
