<p>A nice man called <a href="http://twitter.com/zeroinfluencer">David</a> tweeted me yesterday with a link to a video of Russell Davies talking about interestingness, size and creativity. In the video, Russell <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=6F1T9RDBY3I">refers to a project I did</a> a couple of years ago for Birdseye. I just wanted to thank David as it's always nice to know there are people out there who share the passions I get out of bed for:-)</p>

<p>I've been thinking about advertising agencies big and small, partly because of the <span class="caps">LGFE </span>reunion this thursday and partly because I'm pretty much always stuck in the thick of one or other user-centred design process debate.</p>

<p>I sent the following question to a recruiter this morning as we're talking about maybe working together. I don't know the answer, but I'm pretty sure it's tough for a passionate user experience person to work without discovery... </p>

<p>Here was the question I had in mind:</p>

<blockquote><p>80% of the magic of user-centered design happens in the discovery phase, prior to the IA proposing the information model for an interface. As most pitches involve going to the client with a ready-made proposal, agencies tend to find it difficult to produce user-centered design. Does your agency have a strategy in place to overcome this challenge?</p></blockquote>

<p>I suppose the answer is "win the business then shove the IA through the door" but I can't imagine <a href="http://www.fjordaan.net/">this guy</a> or <a href="http://tailwind.wordpress.com/">this guy</a> playing it like that...</p>

<p>Are you a senior agency bod? How do you handle ideas of value, resonance, co-creation and needs assessment? I'm still working on the question :-)</p>
