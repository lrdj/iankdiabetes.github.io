<p>Never mind the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2009/10/17/how-wall-street-is-making-its-billions/">pithy and insightful piece</a> on yet more examples of why all bankers should be shot, this has to be the funniest comment I've seen in ages:</p>

<blockquote><p>Because oligarchs draw incorrect conclusions about human evolution from Dawkins, "The Selfish Gene", misunderstand mythological self-determinism fables from Ayn Rand, and don't grok that Adam Smith's tales about the "Invisible Hand" were allegorical, we all must suffer. And, somehow we believe our angry powerhouse of a cleptocracy is the absolute zenith of human existence. Absolute fucking madness.</p></blockquote>
