<p>All in all, if B+M want to do the MT thing full time, they have to charge. It's always a sting when something you've used for free goes paying, but in their case there really isn't any other way.</p>

<p>Or, to rephrase, maybe Ben and Mena should just kill MT altogether and just live off the TypePad revenue. After all, it's their baby they can do what they like with it. I think on the whole they feel 'responsible' to the community they helped create.</p>

<p>My complaint is down to the structure of the license. Commercial use (or non-casual use) isn't to do with the number of blogs or authors. I personally publish about 20 sites, but only two or three are 'active' and only one really gets any traffic. If the 'trust' model holds up then I should be able to say that I 'benefit' from three blogs, and should compensate MT acordingly.</p>

<p>I know pricing by page views or logged-on publishing hours is impracticle, but I hope the guys try to find a new definition of what constitutes the benefit we need to be paying for.</p>
