<p>OK all, no time to reply to emails, have just woken up and must rush back to hospital. The potted bits:</p>

<ul>
<li>H Edward Falby born <s>04:30</s> 04:52 on Feb 8 2006 (why is it always in the middle of the night? Maybe to prep you for not sleeping anymore)</li>
<li>Weight 7lb6oz</li>
<li>Delivered by emergency ceasarian section at 8cm dillation (why they ask you to spend all day suffering to get dillated and then just cut it out. Could have c-sected at breakfast and cut out the contractions bit!)</li>
<li>Both boy and mother are doing well (except that Nicki feels like she's been run over by a bus)</li>
<li>Visiting status not yet sorted, but prob ok from this pm onwards and it looks like Nicki and Hal will be on the ward for at least three days</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to everyone for the messages and emails:-)</p>
