<p>So I have this theory&hellip;</p>

<p>Now that the <span class="caps">USA </span>is the world's sole superpower, and given that the <span class="caps">USA </span>uses up most of the world's resources and spews most of the world's greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, I think it might be time to change the way we elect the person in charge of this mess. In a nutshell, I think the President of the United States should be elected by an electoral college picked from the all the countries in the world.</p>

<p>Essentially, the President is now so powerful, it doesn't make sense for the American people to elect him anymore. In fact, it/05/make sense to pick a candidate from the whole world, not just from native-borne American citizens. Can you imagine what the world would be like if the US was run by Vaclav Havel?</p>
