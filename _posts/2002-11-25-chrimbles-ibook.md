<p>Is <a href="http://chris.carline.org/000261.html#000261">due to arrive today</a>. Which is good, always nice to have high-tech Unix geeks enjoying the benefits of superior hardware;-)</p>

<p>The thing I find a wee bit surprising is that Chris intends to write applescripts... shurly shome mishtake...</p>
