<p>Footage taken by Ohna in 1982, hanging out in Fairholm Hall on West 121 Street at Columbia Universtity in <span class="caps">NYC.</span> Footage includes lots of cigarette smoke, Dug, Bill, Jose-Antonio and Robert. Nothing much to look at but it's always fun to do a bit of time-travel.</p>

<p>Ohna was visiting with a 16mm Bolex mechanical cin√© camera borrowed from her uni upstate.</p>

Notes from Ohna 5 April 2011</p>

<p>I can't reply within Donkey site as it won't let me sign in as anything - yeah not my forte! So maybe you can pass on to Ben... in Charles de Gaulle Air France business lounge on my way to Buenos Aires!</p>

<p>Funnily enough on my youtube the music I used located me &amp; I get a few things posted onto my site about - as well as a funny comment about something who played it with different music - There She Goes by the Las. In fact when i did it orginally I used Dear Prudence by Siouxie &amp; The Banshees</p>
