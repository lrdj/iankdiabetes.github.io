Turns out the post office (RMG for royal mail group) runs a ginormous logistics operation in the Netherlands (it's called <span class="caps">G.L.S.</span>)</p>

<p>Reading the website reminded me of the back of <em>Asterix et Cleopatre</em>, a book with an epic list of huge numbers on the back (14 litres of Indian ink, 30 brushes, 62 pencils, 1 hard pencil, 27 eraser, 1984 sheets of paper, 16 typewriter ribbons, 2 typewriters and 67 litres of beer etc.) but anyway you like it, the post office surprises once you start looking at the group's performance.</p>

<p>So, the figures:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="caps">GLS </span>has 14,500 employees</li>
<li>Handles over 1 million parcels a day</li>
<li>Has network of 667 depots</li>
<li>29 central transhipment points</li>
<li>16,000 delivery vehicles</li>
<li>1,700 long distance trucks</li>
<li>It has 220,000 customers in 34 states across Europe</li>
</ul>

<p>Now <span class="caps">THATS </span>what I call a logistics business:-)</p>
