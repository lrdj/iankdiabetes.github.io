<p>Rob Ferrara <a title="CrabAppleLane Blog: Monday Morning QB - December 18, 2006 Issue" href="http://www.crabapplelane.net/roblog/archives/2006/12/18/monday_morning_17.php">isn't 100% in agreement</a> re Flickr. His point is that the free account doesn't give him enough of an incentive to upgrade.</p>

<p>On reflection I agree. Apart from the previously mentioned web2.0-ness of it all (api, sharing etc) the other thing I love is the offer of at least theoretically infinite image hosting. There are no idiotic limits apart from a bandwidth choke but to give you an idea, I've never gone over 2% consumption of my allowance.</p>

<p>I think if Rob leaves a comment to clarify his reasons for not upgrading I shall offer him a pro account as a Christmas gift :-)</p>
