<p>Way hey! 8 minutes 43 seconds for an all-template all-entry total rebuild. My guess is this could be further optimized by redoing my templates (still using the 3.33 ones) and turning off a few templates that don't <em>really</em> need a refresh every time.</p>

<p>Considering the size of Donkey's database, the fact that it's being published to three parallel blogs (multiple template mappings for shufflebox, list apart and current) this is beginning to look really good, so congrats to everyone involved:-)</p>
