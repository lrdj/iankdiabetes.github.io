<p>Dave Sifry asks <a title="Technorati Weblog: 2006 New Years Resolutions" href="http://www.technorati.com/weblog/2005/12/70.html">what are your New Years resolutions?</a></p>

<p>Well, the one I'm most going to struggle with is finding an alternative to Gmail. After last year's Adsense fiasco (The Lecture List was almost forced off the road the Google dogma juggernaught) and the continuing total lack of accountability that Google appears to be able to bask in indefinitely, I'm still struggling to find a commercial alternative.</p>

<p>My theory was that if I didn't trust Google anymore, I could cancel all my Google accounts and pay a supplier for the service. Paying, while a bit of a sting, would give me independence and a level of service. Most importantly, it gave me some level of control over my privacy.</p>

<p>It's now the 2nd of January 2006 and I've been looking to make the change since last October. I still can't find a service that offers the benefits of Gmail! I've seen a few Outlook-based monsters and a whole bunch of terrible unix 'pop wrapper' apps but nothing that works as seamlessly.</p>

<p>Help me out here ok?</p>

<p>Oh, and speaking of resultions, could we have one between Urkarine and Russia like pretty quickly before this gets out of control please?</p>
