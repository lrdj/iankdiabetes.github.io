<p>It's great to see the <a href="http://www.reevoo.com/b2b/2011/02/harnessing-crowd-commerce-with-ask-an-owner/">Ask an owner</a> function live on <a href="http://dixons.co.uk">dixons.co.uk</a> and the service is working well. Reevoo have been making a lot less marketing noise than competitors so it's great to see their hard work and ingenuity pay off.</p>

<p>If I had one comment about the UX it's that when the panel opens, the user is presented with previous answers (not a question interface). To get to the form, one needs to scroll down to the bottom of the panel. Maybe in the next version they can get an "Ask a question" link near the top. Probably one for <span class="caps">MVT</span>;-)</p>
