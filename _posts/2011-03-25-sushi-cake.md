<p>Nicki baked a bunch of cakes for a Japan relief cake and sushi sale at school. My contribution was sushi icing. They ended up looking great, we even had a squirt of 'wasabe' between the 'rice' and the 'salmon'...</p>

<p>Yeah, OK I didn't actually taste one but the kids seemed to like them:-)</p>
