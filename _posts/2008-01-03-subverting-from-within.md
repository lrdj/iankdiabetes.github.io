<p>So I used to think I was subverting from within. That's bollocks, of course. <a title="Zero influence" href="http://zeroinfluence.wordpress.com/">David</a> always reminds me of that. I've decided I'm not going to work in advertising again, the daily round of social network metrics and the constant quest to shove us through some absurd value funnel (ad agencies are still in the process of discovering the creation of unique value, not exactly at the cutting edge of stuff really...) just goes against my belief in a collaborative internet.</p>

<p>A new-year's prediction from Zero Influence really cheered me up. Dave reckons that this year will "reward participation that does not seek measurement nor rewardâ€?</p>
