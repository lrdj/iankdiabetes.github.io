<p>Saturday with CLF--we saw many things this afternoon.</p>
<p>We looked at the Phoenix in East Finchley (C saw The Muppets there earlier this year)</p>
<p>We looked at giraffes in Regents Park (and their giraffe-shaped doors)</p>
<p>We looked at Hamleys (just the outside, we were on a budget today)</p>
<p>We looked at Eros in Piccadilly Circus (and lots of tourists and billboards)</p>
<p>We looked at Nelson's column (from the back) and wondered about all the extra police and Pall Mall being partially closed (I figured it was the Save our hospitals <a href="http://www.keepournhspublic.com/meetings/20130518London.pdf">No to privatisation</a> march but not sure where the Department of Heath was. Didn't fancy getting kettled with CLF as she's not a fan of crowds). The police may have been there to keep an eye on the Morris dancers but we couldn't be sure...</p>

<p>We looked at Vincent's yellow chair then walked around the museum. Had a couple of good "what can you see" observation things with good spotting of scallop shells, keys, scythes, cats and canaries. Stopped at Degas, Gustave Moreau, Seurat (Bathers at Asni√®res 1884) and tested the leather couch in front of Hogarth's The Graham Children (1742). Loads to figure out if you just sit there and look (does the cat behind the chair ready to pounce on the canary foretell future conflict that might endanger the children in the picture? Is the pram handle on the floor supposed to suggest a fallen sceptre?).</p>
<p>At which point we hopped back on the bike and chased a stretch limo around Trafalgar Square. Three girls leaning out the window (that smelt like cleaning fluid) doing their best to ignore us.</p>
<p>We looked at Buckingham Palace, the Serpentine, Baker Street, St John's Wood high Street and stopped at the crepe stand in Hampstead. Picked up flowers for Nicki from the stand at the Spaniards and back to Whetstone.</p>
<p>All in all, nice to be hanging out and looking at the world go by. So CLF, what shall we do next week?</p>
