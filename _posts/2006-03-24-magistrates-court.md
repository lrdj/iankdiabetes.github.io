Back when I was commuting to Salisbury I picked up a speeding ticket and looking at the evidence paperwork the rozzers sent I thought I had spotted a procedural mistake.</p>

<p>Anyhoo -- banged to rights, guilty, guilty, guilty.</p>

<p>Still, the court was in Devizes which was nice, and very helpful and friendly they were too. After the verdict I treated myself to a Pint of 6X, a cigar, a beef, suet and 6X pudding and another pint of 6X and got some reading in. Sort of a mini-holiday from the daily London family thing...</p>
