<p>So Billy got tickets to the Timeout mayoral hustings at the <span class="caps">UCL </span>union tonight. It was reasonably interesting with Ken coming off quite easily the meatiest, most satisfying proposition. Spoke to <a href="http://www.brianpaddick.org/">Brian Paddick</a> without knowing who he was (note to Brian and any other candidate who isn't the front-runner: start all chats with the electorate with "Hi I'm Brian Paddick and I'm running for mayor")</p>

<p>The floppy blond thing from Henley couldn't make it but he had an army of supporters there to explain why so that's alright then...</p>
