<p>More fantastic spam, this time, from Italy, home of the longer-lasting Channel No5. Is it just me or are these people cheeky in the extreme</p>

<p><q> We would like to take this opportunity to offer you our fine selection of Italian crafted Rolex Timepieces.You can view our large selection of Rolexes (including Breitling, Tag Heuer, Cartier etc)</q></p>

<p>So they sell luxury watches right? So what does "Italian crafted" mean?</p>

<p><q> As we are the direct manufacturers, you are guaranteed of lowest prices and highest quality each and every time you purchase from us.</q></p>

<p>Or, in other words, they manufacture counterfeit goods:-) I've had a look at the site and found the <span class="caps">IWC </span>copies very convincing, and at $60 a pop i could just be tempted...</p>
