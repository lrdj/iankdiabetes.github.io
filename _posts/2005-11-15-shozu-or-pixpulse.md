<p>There's an <a title="Roland Tanglao's Weblog: PixPulse - Didn't mean to be so harsh -it's just that I hate email" href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/11/10/pixpulse_didnt_mean_to_be_so_harsh_its_just_that_i_hate_email">interesting conversation</a> going on between David Xue, the founder of <a href="http://pixpulse.com/">PixPulse</a> and <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/">Roland Tanglao</a> about the pros and cons of using email as a method to share mobile content.</p>

<p>I have to agree with Roland that email sucks for the job. I used email to upload to Flickr for ages until <a href="http://www.shozu.com/">ShoZu</a> came along. Shozu uses replication technology that creates a sort of <em>background persistent connection</em> it removes the requirement to have reception which of course is required for email to work.</p>
