<p>Glad to see Iain Tait <a title="The Value of Experimentation at iain tait | crackunit.com" href="http://www.crackunit.com/2006/10/18/the-value-of-experimentation/">is experimenting</a> (and, in the process has found a place to buy genitals).</p>

<p>I just read quite an interesting report by Elizabeth Coverdale called <a href="http://www.usi.edu/libarts/amalgam/elizabethcoverdale.pdf">Cyberculture and Gender Identification in Online Chat Communities</a>. She looks at role-play, gender reassignment and in particular digs a little deeper into the language people use when "inworld" (be that in full 3d environments like <a href="http://www.secondlife.com">Second Life</a> or simply chatting over an IM client). </p>

<p>It turns out that men and women have subtle differences in the way they structure a conversation. According to Coverdale, women pepper their conversation with meta-messages design to create a mood, they use phrases like <strong>giggles</strong> or "lol" more frequently than men with an aim of creating a cocoon of aproval and friendship around the conversation. Men will just say what they want in shorter phrases with little or no introduction.</p>

<p>I can't say this has been my experience. I find myself often drifting into a world of emoticons when I chat...</p>

<p>My Second Life avatar is currently a young Korean woman and while I'm still just roaming around figuring out the various inworld dynamics I can imagine things could get a little wierd. (If you take a look at Iain's post and are confused by the pictures, a Google search should give you a clue... and cheesh, I'm reminded I never did find out what the three shells do in <em>Demolition Man</em>)</p>
