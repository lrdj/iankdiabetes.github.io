<p>Question: why does my iPhone not sync automatically (or even manually) with with my Powerbook via wifi when both are on the same network and iTunes is running (hell, why isn't their a syncd process running in the background).</p>

<p>I'm finding the 'tethered device' design of the ipod increasingly annoying but for the iPhone which is by nature a wireless device to still follow the same method is just silly...</p>
