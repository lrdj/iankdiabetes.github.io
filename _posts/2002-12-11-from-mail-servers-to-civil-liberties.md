<p>From a list I'm on&mdash;the post started with commentary on scripting the <span class="caps">EIMS </span>mail server and finished with this. Quite encouraging I thought...</p>

<p><q> But I <span class="caps">WILL NOT </span>log their activities. Traffic stats to their websites are calculated and the original logs deleted. Email activities are not logged at all, beyond whatever shows up in the current activity windows. <br /><br /> If somebody shows up with a subpoena, I can truthfully say that I can't give them what doesn't exist. Or am I violating yet another obscure Federal statute I've never heard of? Seems to me that we (Americans, mostly, but not all...) have been busy throwing our hard-won liberties overboard in a misguided attempt to keep the ship afloat, and I won't be any part of it. Rather the ship should sink than live aboard without them. </q></p>
