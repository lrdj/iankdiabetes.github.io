<p>Love <a href="http://www.coudal.com/unsolicited.php">Coudal's response</a> to the agencydotcom <a title="YouTube - Going to Work for SUBWAY: Part 1" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8eV6OuC8Oo">Subway thing</a></p>

<p>My thoughts...</p>

<ul>
<li>White people dissing the poor</li>
<li>The ad biz can now generate its own w.o.m. effect (well, we knew that already--see viralmonitor)</li>
<li>The hairdressing budget must have been massive</li>
<li>Miami has ad-schools?</li>
</ul>
