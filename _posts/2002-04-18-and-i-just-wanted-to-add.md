<p>that we have a socialist government. (Michael Howard just said "good evening" and has started telling of one of his constituents who waited 83 weeks to see a consultant. Michael Howard. Surely you remember? arg!?)</p>

<p>I had almost completely lost hope for this government. I've voted red my whole life, mostly losing at the polls. When Tony Blair got in I was elated, but I've been growing increasingly disappointed with the lack of political commitment coming from number 10. Tony recently gave a 'pep-talk' to the party faithful. Roy Hattersley commented on the speech, pinpointing the real flaw it uncovered: a total lack of political position. I believe the pm used the word "decency" - as in Labour is the party of decency. Well, that's a complete load of bollocks, I can find you any number of evil bastards who actually believe in decency. For that mater, even Michael Howard, the shadow chancellor might perhaps be into decency.</p>

<p>We have had Labour by stealth these last few years - I keep having to remind myself of the actual policy decisions (and there have been one or two) that celebrate the belief in a fairer society. This budget is the first time that this government has got up on in its (well, Gordon's anyway) hind legs and delivered a genuinely left-wing policy.</p>

<p>Of course, I wanted Tony Benn not Blair, but you've got to start somewhere (and how about all the fuss Arlette Laguiller is kicking up across the channel)...</p>
