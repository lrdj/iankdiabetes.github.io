<p>Hey, we've just had a <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/le_enraged_mutton/is_bt_still_shit.html#comment-23629">long and very informative post</a> from Matt, a Luton-based Openreach engineer. I hope this really is an engineer speaking and not some perverse item from a 'guerilla marketing' agency subverting from within. He describes some real horror stories, if you're interested in the BT thing it's well worth a read:</p>

<blockquote><p>I was on a fault last week and the customer drop-wire from the pole to the house was rubbing through trees so I replaced it only to get a phone call the next day from my manager asking why I hadn't charged the customer as the trees were on his property--this is the level that they are stooping to.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do they care? This thing has been simmering for a while now, I wonder at what point a BT pr person is going to chime in?</p>
