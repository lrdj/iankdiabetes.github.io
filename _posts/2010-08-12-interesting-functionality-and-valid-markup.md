<p>I just recently discovered this website on my virtual travels. The design's pretty sweet, and it uses a lot of interesting jQuery and <span class="caps">CSS </span>functions (it's overkill in places). But the most impressive thing about the site, to me at least, is the fact it's valid script.</p>

<p>Certainly not a huge deal, but seeing so many sites trying new techniques and compromising their standards it was nice to catch one that sorted both out.</p>
