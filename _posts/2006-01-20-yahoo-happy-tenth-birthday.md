<p>So nice little quilt graphic from Yahoo (<a title="Yahoo! Netrospective: 10 years, 100 moments of the Web" href="http://birthday.yahoo.com/netrospective/">Yahoo! Netrospective: 10 years, 100 moments of the Web</a>) for their birthday.</p>

<p>When I see this type of thing I start wondering about what was left out...</p>

<p>I can see two things missing straight away</p>

<ol>
<li>Jenicam</li>
<li>Google</li>
</ol>

<p>Any other omissions come to mind?</p>
