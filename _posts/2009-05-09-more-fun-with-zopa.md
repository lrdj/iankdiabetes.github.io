<p>(the following sent to Zopa helpdesk)</p>

<p>Your system is simply diabolical. I have now been locked out twice and cannot access the 400 pounds in my account.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Zopa your account is locked" src="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/zopa-renew.jpg" width="516" height="173"  style="" /></span></p>

<p>Your password reset and security questions are designed to <span class="caps">FAIL.</span> Quite simply, both my bank accounts (Lloyds and Barclays) have online security systems which are safe (enough) and (largely) usable.</p>

<p>I am desperate to transact with you and your systems but ever since my first unfortunate encounter with your registration process (see <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/2007/05/post-1.html">donkeyontheedge.com/2007/05/post-1.html</a> for details of the first fiasco) through the support email loop that <span class="caps">FAIL</span>ed to resolve my simple issues right through to your current password reset mechanism I have been thwarted by your hostile, ham-fisted and incompetent user experience design.</p>

<p>Please, please, please. Let me set the security questions or at least choose from a list of options (I have no idea what my first school is, and if I put dummy data in the field it is unlikely I will remember it come the time to reset my password) and reduce the case-sensitivy of non-evident or non-mnemonic security phrases. I mean is my town of birth "sanfrancisco, san Fransisco, Sanfrancisco, San Francisco and why not San francisco or San-Francisco?!? </p>

<p>Your systems need way more flexibility and much, much greater intelligence.</p>

<p>And plllllllease reset my frigging account so I can get my mits on my cash <span class="caps">NOW.</span> OK?!?</p>

<p>All the best<br />
Dug</p>
