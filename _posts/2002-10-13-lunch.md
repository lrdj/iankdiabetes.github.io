<p>Very tasty lunch at Liz and Stu's. Liz prepared jambon persill&eacute; the proper way (boil pig's trotter with aromatics etc.). I haven't had home made meat jelly in a long time, bit of a treat really. She followed that up with a b&oelig;uf bourguignon and a selection of english cheeses. Pudding involved a smooth vanilla scented custard, crumbly pastry and apples.</p>

<p>Thank you Liz:-)</p>
