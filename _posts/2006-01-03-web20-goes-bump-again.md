<p>Flickr is currently displaying the following header message on all pages:</p>

<blockquote><p>Is Flickr acting weird for you? That's because the servers are running <span class="caps">HOT </span>right now.</p></blockquote>

<p>Same questions arise as before. We all thought there was now only one way to skin this cat--that webdev was completely commoditised and that reliable scalability was no big deal. Apparently not;-)</p>

<p>It'd be great to be able to read a report from Yahoo/Flickr on the technology they're using and why it goes wrong...</p>
