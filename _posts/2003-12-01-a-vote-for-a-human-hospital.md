<p>1. Go <a href="http://www.healthyhospitals.org.uk/vote/vote.html">here</a></p>

<p>2. Check the box marked "click to vote for this vision" next to "muf architecture/art with Rosetta Life"</p>

<p>3. Scroll down, fill in the text boxes and click on "SUBMIT <span class="caps">YOUR VOTE</span>"</p>

<p>Of course, if you're not in a rubber-stamping frame of mind, you should read the <a href="http://www.healthyhospitals.org.uk/muf/muf_proposal.pdf">proposal</a>, and view the very cool <a href="http://www.healthyhospitals.org.uk/muf/clive512k.mov">film</a> (and its <a href="http://www.healthyhospitals.org.uk/muf/clive_transcript.pdf">transcript</a>) before you vote.</p>
