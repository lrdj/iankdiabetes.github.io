<p>Watson-Marlow Bredel, the best printers pump. Watson-Marlow Bredel peristaltic pump customers benefit from low shear metering of coatings and inks, so eliminating foaming. In addition, accurate flow control and quickest change-over time, combined with rugged industrial design, makes these pumps best practice for a rapidly growing number of printers.
