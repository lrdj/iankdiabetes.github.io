<p>Or "have scent" in <a href="http://www.uie.com/handouts/UIE_ScentOfInformation.pdf">the words of Jared Spool</a> </p>

<p>In the article he mentions Are Halland's <em>Cores and Paths</em> methodology:</p>

<blockquote><p>The idea is brilliantly simple: First, you have a core. This could be content, a feature, functionality, or even a work flow. Find what that is and design it first. Note that in doing this you necessarily have to get clarity from stakeholders and from the project team as to what it is that you should focus on.</p></blockquote>
