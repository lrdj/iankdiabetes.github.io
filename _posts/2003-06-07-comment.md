<p>Got this lovely note yesterday (I know, I know. I need to enable comments--I've just been too busy. I should have Donkey on Moveable Type soon)</p>

<p><q>Just wanted to drop a line to let you know I really appreciated your blog entry today on your website. My grandpa was a young US Army private in the Normandy invasion. There was nothing I loved more as a child than to sit and listen to him recount tales of World War Two (he was also at the Battle of the Bulge). Your entry today brought back lots of really fantastic memories and again leant appreciation for the efforts of the free world on that fateful day. <br /> Damon </q></p>
