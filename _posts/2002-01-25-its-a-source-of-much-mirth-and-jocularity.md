That I have the spelling skills of a four-year-old. Taunts and jeers to dug@pumpernickle.net if you please.

This is crazy, really. I'm bilingual and manage in a further two languages. You'd think spelling in your mother tongue would be the easy part (ah - yes, but I can't spell in French either...). And there's another thing, as I am about to be a dad for the first time, I'm wondering if I should speak French to my baby. This is probably a seriously stupid idea as it will no doubt make the difficult (I'm guessing) process of learning to speak even more confusing for baby.
