<p>This, from Hanan Levin a week ago and not sure what to do about it...</p>

<p><q> Wow, doug, <br /> Thanks for linking to grow-a-brain, and wow, couldn't imagine that my approach got you to suspect that i am affiliated w/ Microsoft?#*?! <br /> Now i have a question: how can i remove the forever quote acusing me for spamming? not the best thing to pop as # 3 when people google growabrain?... <br /> Anyway, i found some cool links on your blog &amp; will link to them this weekend (w/ credit)... </q></p>

<p>He's referring to an <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/permalinker/?pid=11325&amp;blog=donkey">earlier post</a> where I questioned the 'purpose' of his site. This is increasingly a fine line--the site <em>does</em> has some quality links and <em>is</em> frequently updated by an enthusiast, but then there's this heavy referring to his real estate business and the separation between them is a bit unclear.</p>

<p>In any case, there's not a lot I can do about my post's position on Google, but I'd welcome thoughts on where that line is and whether this guy is a respectable blogger or a sleazy salesman, or indeed if it's even possible to make that sort of distinction. Or, in other words, what does he mean by 'his approach'?</p>

<p>I'm all the more concerned as I've just added a Paypal "donate" button...</p>
