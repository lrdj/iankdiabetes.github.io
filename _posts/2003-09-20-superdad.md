<p>Sitting in the Office working on a new site design and it just occurred to me that I'm doing three people's jobs in a four day week and being an available and supportive superdad in the hours in between.</p>

<p>We're talking about moving house again (third time lucky?). Do you think I'll navigate myself into the same crazy situations if I switch to being a cheese-maker in Dorset or a furniture designer in Suffolk?</p>

<p>mmm...</p>

<p>Oh, and I've just got a &pound;600 phone bill from Orange. How outrageous is <em>that</em>?</p>
