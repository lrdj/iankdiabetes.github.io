<p>Well, still no baby. But I've uploaded some snaps from the inside of Nicki's ward and great news for Sam and Ben - they have a (not-so-little) girl called Georgia. She is the prettiest thing I've ever seen and Nicki held her for a while in the hopes of tweaking the right get-a-move-on hormones. Needless to say, no dice.</p>

<p>Also from the <span class="caps">NCT </span>mob, Michela and Andreas Staab arrived earlier in the labour ward. Michela was doing the water birth thing at the Edgeware, but when her waters broke, they found evidence of meconium so had to ship down to the Royal Free, just in case. So if only Junior Falby would get a move on, we could have a party in the neo-natal ward;-)</p>
