<p>Thank you <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Zeldman</a> for pointing to <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/aqtree2/">this script</a> by kryogenix.org:</p>

<p><q> aqTree2: explorer-style trees from unordered lists. What it is: Below is an unordered list, which will be converted by the included JavaScript library into an explorer-tree structure if you've got a browser capable of doing it... </q></p>

<p>This way I'll have spent my whole day thinking about ways for <span class="caps">DOM </span>manipulation to use standard html constructs in funky new way :-)</p>

<p>Oh, and by the way, the earlier example isn't real code, so don't go telling me how it should be using the GetElementByID method ok?</p>
