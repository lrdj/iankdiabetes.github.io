<p>Hi dug,</p>

<p>I thought 70% of the electorate voted? We watched newsnight last night and Christine Ockrent was going on about how "one in four (!!!)" didn't even bother to vote. I was thinking that that's a pretty good turnout compared to most places.</p>

<p>It always pisses me off when I hear people saying "oh, if only I'd known, I'd have gone out and voted". It's like a football player saying "if only I'd known they were going to score three late goals, I'd have tried harder in the first half". Actually, it's worse cos a footballer easing off when in front is more likely to be something he can't really control.</p>

<p>It is scary, though, to think how many voted for him. In some places, he got 30% of the vote. And then you look at trends in other countries in Europe. Ulp!</p>

<p>B-)</p>
