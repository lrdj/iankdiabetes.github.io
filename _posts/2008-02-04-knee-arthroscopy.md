<p>So I've now had the pleasure of being slid into an <span class="caps">MRI </span>and in a few minutes, a man called John Hardy (my trusty orthopaedic surgeon) is going to regularise a tear in the meniscus in my right knee (thank you <span class="caps">TMW </span>softball). </p>

<p>08:36 scratch that, doc and anesthetist (sp?) have a full-on knee replacement in theatre before me. Will need to wait a bit longer. On the plus side, I should get a <span class="caps">DVD </span>from the orthroscope which I will get up on YouTube as soon as poss.</p>

<p>09:16 JH and sleepman David Coates are doing a knee replacement I'm next in the queue.</p>

<p>09:51 anti-embolism stockings. I'm told to treat them like silk stockings</p>

<p>10:47 still no news :-(</p>

<p>Well, shortly before 11:15 David Coates injected me with a quart of martinis. The next thing I remember is having the best n<br />
ap in the recovery room (boy, I'll bet recovery-room staff have got some juicy material for a book) and then Nicki showed up next my bed :-)</p>

<p>Have now seen the physio and am waiting for nurse to redo dressing before heading home.</p>

<p>Thanks to all who tweeted, called and texted the messages really helped.</p>
