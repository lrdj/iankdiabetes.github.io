<p>Currently working on social marketplaces (ad-hod associations) and came across <a href="http://www.experientia.com/blog/tinkering-to-the-future/">this interesting piece</a> over on experientia's blog (actually, it links to vodafone's <a href="http://www.receiver.vodafone.com/tinkering-to-the-future">receiver</a>). Interesting stuff, we've been thinking about cognitive surplus mixed with a renewed conscience of doing the right thing, mixed with the renewed desire to participate and qualified by the renewed interest in sustainability, self-sufficiency and the desire to make stuff. </p>

<blockquote><p>Tinkering is about seizing the moment: it is about ad-hoc learning, getting things done, innovation and novelty, all in a highly social, networked environment.</p></blockquote>

<p>What I like about the idea of tinkering is that it can start small and almost by accident. You could be tinkering away at solving a problem and could quite easily join forces with others you meet by chance online. Who knows where it goes from there ;-)</p>
