<p>You know, when I started this thing I thought "gee, we're spending cash on a fancy bathroom refit, why not be mr helpful and do the back room?"</p>

<p><a href="/scrapbook/index.mgi?act=showpic&amp;frame=9"><img src="/assets/i/ixus/t/9.jpg" width="80" height="80" class="pic_idx" style="padding-right:3px;" align="left" /></a> This was never supposed to be a marathon I mean it's a tiny little room - how hard could it be? But for the last I can't remember how long I've been bashing away in there. There is not a single solitary inch of wall, ceiling or even floor that did not require some form of engineering or design...</p>

<p>But we're nearly there, which is a good thing considering we almost gave birth yesterday ;-)</p>
