<p>On 2nd June 1953 my dad had just turned 18. He was a Queen's Scout, and attended the coronation as part of the "Scouts on duty at Coronation of HM Queen Elizabeth II" effort. I was trying to find some items that might show Hal and <span class="caps">CLF </span>what it would have been like to be a Queen's Scout on the day, but the nearest I've come across is this <span class="caps">RKO</span> Newsreel footage. </p>

<p>I wonder which one of those young guys in shorts is Grandad Jed?</p>
