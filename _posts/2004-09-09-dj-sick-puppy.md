<p>Having the stereo in my flat hooked up with <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">AirTunes</a> is beginning to change the way I think of albums. I've always struggled with playlists&#8212;the amount of time you need to spend on them to get something that isn't full of bits you need to skip over really precludes doing anything else with your life.</p>

<p>So I've started listening to these large (70meg+) mp3 downloads. <a href="http://www.sickpuppydog.com/">One guy in particular</a> has spent a lot of time on air recently. I'm just begining to burn out on his &#8220;Slugs and snails&#8221; and am just getting into &#8220;Steal this music&#8221;&#8230;</p>
