<p>Right, all <a href="http://w3mix.web-graphics.com/">the entries</a> are in and I have to say I am very surprised how crap most of them are. Having not entered myself, I should really keep my trap shut, but we're talking a (admittedly hypothetical) redesign of the <span class="caps">W3C </span>site. This is a contract to redesign the Louvre, the World Trade Center, the pyramids, you know, the Alpha and the Omega, the fount of all knowledge, the club founded by <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/"><span class="caps">TBL</span></a> himself...</p>

<p>Check out the entries, most either just plain broke in my browser (IE5) or perhaps more seriously, made no attempt to think of the w3c site as a key information application. Anyway, if I had to pick one it would be <a href="http://www.martinrack.de/projekte/w3c/">this chap</a></p>

<p>To be honest, I'd rather they scrap the entries altogether and start again with some serious designers on board. What would <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37 sigs</a> make of it?</p>
