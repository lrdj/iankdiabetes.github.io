<p>Just so I know, exactly what hapened to make the amount of comment spam I'm getting shoot up overnight?</p>

<p>I've just had three days of pain and suffering trying to get a bunch of category-related MT plugins to work and failing:-( So the thought of struggling with <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MTB</span></span>lacklist is looking pretty unhappy right now&#8230;</p>

<p>For the record, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MTN</span></span>extInCategory and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MTN</span></span>extCategory (two separate plugins would you beleive &#8212; can we not just have category handling built in please Ben?) failed the same way. For some reason, MT didn't parse their close tags (ie it output the tags as is).</p>

<p>Strange, no?</p>
