<p>(Billy:)</p>

<p>You just reminded me of how worrying it all is. We were scared for most of the Apoa pregnancy, also during the birth, and even afterwards. My auntie Isobel always says "ye've nae worries until ye have kids, and then ye've nothing but worries". Cheery thought, eh?</p>

<p>It is indeed a bit of a roller-coaster ride (and only the beginning for Nick and I) this parenthood thing. Luckily, all of Billy's children are well :-) Hopefully one forgets the bad bits and only remembers the wonder. I'm pretty sure my mom looks back fondly on having two under-eights (of course things are going to get rocky at puberty)</p>
