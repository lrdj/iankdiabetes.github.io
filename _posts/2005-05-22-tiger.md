<p>Well, I've been on the verge of buying <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Tiger</a> and going through the upgrade thing with the five-odd machines I'm responsible for. It looks like I'll loose key functionality if I do (<a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/1006">virtual switch networking</a>) and I don't like the look of <a href="http://seclists.org/lists/fulldisclosure/2005/May/0426.html">this vulnerability</a></p>

<p>So guys, how about you call me when Dashboard requires explicit, dashboard-specific authorisation before it gets handed root privileges, ok?</p>
