<p>Have had to work from Mum's house in Devon yesterday and today so ended up taking the M3/A303 route down to the South West yesterday. I wanted to get a whole day's work in so left the house at 6:30 which just barely got me through London rush-hour... Anyways, on the way down I saw five (5!) speed traps, including one on the M3 where the panda was parked on one of those (now mostly disused) platform ramps to the side of the main carriageway. </p>

<p>It's been years since I last saw a ramp in use so it got me pondering. I ended having to conclude that it was the last day of September and Her Majesty's constabulary was out on the prowl to spend the remaining bits of their budget. That's just crazy, right? I mean does anyone know about these things? Does this happen every month or is it quarterly or even yearly?</p>

<p>The same behaviour happens at work. I can't count the number of times I've been reminded that there will "be no points for not spending the budget" I find this crazy. Why live in fear that you won't get the same amount next year if you can't spend it the previous year. I mean if you can get your shit done spending less cash surely that's a good thing?</p>
