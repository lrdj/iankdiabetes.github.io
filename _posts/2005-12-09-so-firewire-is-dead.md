<p>So apparently, <a title="ï¿½ FireWire not dead, but it's on life support | The Apple Core | ZDNet.com" href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Apple/?p=57">FireWire is on life support</a>--Jason <span class="caps">O'G</span>rady asks what our take is on the death of Firewire. </p>

<p>Well I'm not entirely surprised as it wouldn't be the first time Apple has fanfared the launch of a new technology only to drop it months later. I'd just like to check one thing, how are we supposed to boot the new Intel Powerbooks in target mode? Will this happen via usb2?</p>
