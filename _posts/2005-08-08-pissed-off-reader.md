<p>Received the following from a reader called Andrew MacLaren a few days ago. He does make some good points so I'll see what I can do:-)</p>

<blockquote><p>...by some unfortunate deep linking i somehow landed at your 'website', having spent a few miserable minutes reading your mostly uninspiring and often self-rightous (pap) posts, it would appear to me that in many ways you come across as a borderline wanker, and although that may seem harsh i've just had another look and to put at nicely its a bag of shite! and from what i can gather this is what you actually do!??</p>

<p> Unfiltered commentary on usability...<br />
...interface design, advertising and marketing communication.</p>

<p>surely your site reflects none of the above? It certainly falls flat on its lame ass when it comes to either interface design or usabilty! Although there is consistancy in the layout (black text and blue links), the positioning of the main elements appears confusing while also being extremely flat (not sure what content / links are of most importance), and in terms of 'usabilty' what the fuck is going on with 'Topics and Donkey' and 'Archive' being butchered into a scrollable box? surely if 'Topics on Donkey' contains many of your important links  / latest information - they should be instantly available to the user? but there mainly hidden, which in fairness benefits everyone!</p>

<p>I'm sure this feedback is greatly appreciated and i will no doubt here from you soon.</p>

<p>Your extremely sincerly,<br />
Andy</p></blockquote>
