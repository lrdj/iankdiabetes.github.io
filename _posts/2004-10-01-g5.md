<p>Until this evening, I didn&#8217;t know that the side pannel of the G5 is a four-millimeter-thick slab of brushed aluminium. On the <em>inside</em> of the panel, a stainless steel guide is attached with cross-head stainless steel screws. Set in a grove in that guide is a soft rubber gasket. </p>

<p>The side cover registers with the main housing via two large, stainless steel pins so that when you press the cover shut after installing your ram upgrade, you first feel a gentle &#8216;give&#8217; as the gasket squeezes slightly into its housing. Then, as the pins register, the cover falls closed, its edge perfectly aligning with its mate, leaving but the faintest line to tell that the two pieces are not one.</p>

<p>Right, let&#8217;s plug this mother in:-)</p>
