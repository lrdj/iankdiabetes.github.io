<p>but this em thing is killing me&#8211; just got off the phone to Ben in DC and he says the type's to small. How can that be? 0.8EM (fractionaly smaller than your usual) seemed like a <span class="caps">WAI </span>compliant, sensible, robust and just generally do-the-right-thing kind of body copy measure.</p>

<p>Right, hello giant type face&#8211; I'm leaving it at 1/1.5em for now...</p>
