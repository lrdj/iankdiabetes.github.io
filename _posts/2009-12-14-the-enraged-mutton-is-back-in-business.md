<p>Wow, I knew Bulkregister was good, but I had no idea the industry was evolving in that direction. It's a shame, I've had great service from Bulkregister over the years, but recently the new owners Enom have really been making a pig's ear of the domain registry service.</p>

<p>I felt the greasy end of their incompetence over the weekend and even after a lengthy bout of support ticket ping-pong they refuse to do the right thing. So it looks like I'm in the market for somewhere sensible to maintain my domain registrations. </p>

<p>I guess prices have cooled off a bit in Europe so I might try a UK shop this time. Has anyone got any recommendations?</p>
