<p>I know I&#8217;ve been a bit of a wreck these past couple of days, but I really surprised myself this morning reading Phil Mountain&#8217;s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1332255,00.html">letter to Clark County</a> in The Guardian. By the start of the second sentence I was sobbing violently into my coffee and had totally soaked my t-shirt.</p>
