<p>Just a quick post to apologise for all the portfolio stuff going through this part of the site these past few weeks. I decided to use a part of Donkey as my online portfolio (a necessary evil in my quest for employment)&#8212;As this page is an index of all posts to Donkey, these more specialist posts end up here. I've still got a few to do, but hopefully, the mad rush of last week is now over.</p>

<p>Of course, if you need help with standards-compliant web design or accessibility and art direction you could actually <a href="/portfolio/recent/">visit the portfolio</a> page.</p>
