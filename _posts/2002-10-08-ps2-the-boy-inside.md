<p>On the theme of selfish pleasures, I picked up a Playstation 2 a few weeks back. The replays in Gran Turismo are just too gorgeous for words. Take your Tommy Makinen Evo <span class="caps">VII </span>around Tokyo special stage 11 in the middle of the night, then sit back and enjoy:-) There are flashbulbs going off in the audience, amazing atmospherics, reflections, lens flare and lighting effects are everywhere. This has to be one of the most well designed pieces of software ever :-)</p>

<p>And where else can you tank around a test track in a 600bhp Nismo Skyline at 320kph (that's three hundred and twenty kilometers per hour) in perfect safety?</p>
