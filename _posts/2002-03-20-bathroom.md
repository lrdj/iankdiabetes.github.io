<p>Sophie and Nadinne are recent art school graduates who have moved from their first few jobs to set up on their own as interior designers. They are designing and contracting our bathroom and things are looking up - they're great. Nadinne came round the house yesterday to take photos and discuss every surface at length with Nick. My fingers are crossed, but it looks like we're finally on to a winner.</p>
