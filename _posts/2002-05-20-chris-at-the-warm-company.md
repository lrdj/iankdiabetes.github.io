<p><a href="http://chris.raettig.org/email/jnl00090.html">More legal rubbish</a> Chris and Derek have started trading under the name "warm company" and some other "warm company" in Seattle (yes, trigger-happy lawyers living amongst Starbucks-drinking ingenus) <span class="caps">USA </span>isn't happy about it.</p>

<p>They want Chris to stop trading under the name. This is crazy as they are in a totally different line of work (the other lot make quilts) and damn it, this is pissing me off. When we all started this internet thing it was supposed to be a collaborative effort.</p>

<p>Who let the fucking lawyers in?</p>
