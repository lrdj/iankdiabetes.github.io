<p>Love what this London restaurant is doing on their outside tables. All the chairs have pashminas neatly folded on them for use by customers (that's the pashmina on the chair-back in the left image, on the customer's lap on the right).</p>

<p>This is so perfect on so many levels, the pashmina responds to the context of use ("I'm trying to feel good and enjoy being here with my friends") supporting the need for comfort. The service design angle is great too. Users say they want the freedom to smoke and to be comfortable but they don't want their services harming the environment and so on...</p>

<p>Just perfect:-)</p>
