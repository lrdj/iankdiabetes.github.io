<p>There seems to be a spate of online services going awry. Last week it was TypePad suffering a meltdown, and now it's <a title="del.icio.us: continued hiccups" href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/continued_hiccu.html">continued hiccups</a> for del.icio.us</p>

<p>Interesting to compare the user (and mostly developer) feedback in both cases. The TypePad crash launched a number of complaints about poor communication on 6A's part. On the whole, the developers were grumpy and many were wondering if they could recommend TP as a platform to their clients.</p>

<p>By contrast, the long list of 245 comments on the <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/">del.icio.us blog</a> is overwhelmingly positive and filled with messages of support and commiseration:-)</p>
