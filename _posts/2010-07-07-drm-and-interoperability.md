<p>Loved this piece on <span class="caps">DRM </span>and interoperability by publishers <a href="http://www.enhanced-editions.com/blog/2009/08/on-drm-epub-and-other-thorny-issues/">Enhanced Editions</a></p>

<p>Loved the nice and clear intro:</p>

<blockquote><p>Let's get this straight. We're totally anti-DRM. That's our position. It's not the position of all of our partners, but many of them. Anyway, for now, that's our position. In fact for ever, that's our position.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which is cool coming from an app store content publisher, and this nice and clear explanation of why interoperability is important:</p>

<blockquote><p>In publishing however, <span class="caps">DRM </span>is most closely tied up for consumers - as in music - in interoperability. That's the ability to buy a file that works on any device. So you can buy a book, and read it on your phone, iPhone, laptop, Sony Reader, Kindle, and so on. If a file is <span class="caps">DRM'</span>d, it tends to only be playable on one kind of device, which means it's not-interoperable, and that therefore you don't really "own" it, just rent it. And before you ask, there is no such thing as interoperable <span class="caps">DRM </span>in music or books. For the record, we're all for inter-operability.</p></blockquote>

<p>As I've said before, imagine if your Victrola 78s could only be played on a Victrola-DRM-regulated phonograph. What am I supposed to do with my content once the <span class="caps">DRM </span>manager has gone out of business?</p>
