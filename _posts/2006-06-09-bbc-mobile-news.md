<p>Been playing with the Flash client for <span class="caps">BBC</span> News. It's another example of a technology maturing and converging to the point where it just works. I think this longtime Flash-avoider may have found a new friend in Flash as a rich front-end to <span class="caps">RSS...</span></p>

<p>The service is provided by <a href="http://www.mobizines.com/">mobizines</a> and even includes the <span class="caps">BBC </span>news soundrack to alert you a new edition has arrived :-)</p>
