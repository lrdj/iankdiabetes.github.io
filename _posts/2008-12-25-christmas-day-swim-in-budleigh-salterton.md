<p>Well, merry Christmas all. </p>

<p>The water was extremely cold today but there were no heart attacks or sinking eccentrics... Funny that the <span class="caps">RNIB </span>lifeboat goes up the coast in 60-minute steps as crazy people all along the south coast rush into the freezing waters :-)</p>
