<p>I wrote <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/internet_culture_and_politics/you_heard_it_here_first_2008_is_the_year_of_decommodification.html">a little brain-dump</a> on decommodification this morning and have just now come across <a title="russell davies: tom at interesting (different tom)" href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2007/09/tom-at-intere-1.html">tom at interesting (different tom)</a> a video from <a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/">Russell Davies</a> Interesting 2007 conference.</p>

<p>Tom talks about pipes (or tubes) and starts off his presentation with the example of the tobacco infrastructure, the incredible world of resources and infrastructure required for you to smoke a cigarette...</p>

<p>Which kinda ties-in with the aforementioned telecoms operator's pipes and their relationship to value co-creation...</p>

<p>No conclusions as of yet, but the video is nice, so go watch it:-)</p>
