<p>from <a href="http://www.scamorama.com/zimbabwe2.html">Zimbabwe</a> and from zdnet (<a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105-918960.html">http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105-918960.html</a>)</p>

<p><q> Six people were arrested in South Africa over the weekend on suspicion of being involved in the infamous "Nigerian" e-mail and letter fraud. </q></p>

<p>I thought this was just a variation (different scale, different location) on the classic New York con that goes along the line of "would you just hang on to my money for a few minutes"... (this is sort of like the "<a href="http://www.aarp.org/confacts/money/pigeondrop.html">pigeon drop</a>")</p>

<p>It's funny, this type of thing used to be really popular in New York - it was like getting mugged, everyone had a story to tell...</p>
