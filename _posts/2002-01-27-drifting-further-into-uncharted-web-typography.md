<p>Ok so now the width of this column is defined as thirty times the width of a monospaced character. If you zoom your browser's type-size settings in and out, the width of the column should expand and contract such that there is always a theoretically ideal number of words in each line.</p>

<p>My personal readability preference is for thirteen word lines.</p>
