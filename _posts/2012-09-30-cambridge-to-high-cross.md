<p>Set out on Saturday to cycle home from Cambridge. Expected to follow the Welwyn train line and figured I'd run out of beans by Potters Bar. Unfortunately I drifted a bit east and ended up having a massive climb 1/3 of the way in.</p>

<p>Didn't notice anything unusual at the time but really started flagging well before mile twenty. Also, wore the wrong shorts so crotch on fire fairly quickly. In the end I passed under the <span class="caps">A10 </span>and started down to ware as light began to fade.</p>

<p>Plan to try this again asap but with better shorts and taking the north/south route closer to Royston. Also, really need to get an earlier start!</p>
