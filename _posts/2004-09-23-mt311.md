<p>I've just realised something which I had kind of been keeping my head in the sand about: Movable Type 3.11 is buggy as all hell. Once you start getting anywhere near the red-line, its behaviour silently switches from &#8220;when&#8221; to &#8220;if&#8221;. This is bloody frightening as I've now invested weeks worth of all-nighters getting everything configured properly and now have a number of blogs running on it&#8230;</p>
