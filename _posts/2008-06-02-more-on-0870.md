<p>Having just this second whinged about <span class="caps">O2'</span>s charge for calling 0870 numbers, a comment has just come in on an old <a title="Say no to 0870 (A Donkey on the Edge)" href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/le_enraged_mutton/say_no_to_0870.html">say no to 0870</a> post from March 2005.</p>
