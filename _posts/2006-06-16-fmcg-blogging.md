<p>Good piece on <span class="caps">FMCG </span>blogging over at <a title="Positive Impact : A Nation of Blogkeepers" href="http://blogs.hillandknowlton.com/blogs/niallcook/archive/2006/06/15/3511.aspx">Positive Impact</a> (one of Hill &amp; Knowlton's <em>Collective Conversation</em> channels)</p>

<p>He mentions <a href="http://www.stormhoek.com">Stormhoek</a> among others and includes a link to comments about Flora pro.activ's Lulu activity.</p>

<p>Many good points, but I wanted to add a wee clarification about Flora.</p>

<p>I'm currently working with Flora's agency to investigate and define ways the brands can collaborate (and co-create, of course) with digitally-enabled communities.</p>

<p>While the Lulu activity was before my time, I thought I'd mention that it was never supposed to be a blog (as I understand it the word 'blog' never appeared in any of the ads). </p>

<p>The idea (from looking at the work) was to suggest a feeling of closeness with a celebrity (getting past the bodyguards and high fences). Unilever has <a href="http://www.unilever.co.uk/ourcompany/careers/careerprofiles/marketing/careersinmarketing/marketingcasestudies/floraproactiv.asp">a page on the Lulu activity</a> on its corporate site.</p>

<p>Once you're operating in the celeb space the rules change and you need to work with a whole set of assumptions (say, for instance, that celebs don't write their own copy). I think the man on the street understands these mechanics and I doubt any mums out there thought Lulu was actually blogging her experiences as you or might have.</p>

<p>That said, Lulu did genuinely have high cholesterol. She <i>did</i> eat all the products and believe it or not, they did help lower her cholesterol:-)</p>

<p>This highlights one of the conundrums faced by brand managers who want to enter the co-creation space: many brands have real, positive stories to tell, but even these seem to fear the airing of a single item of bad news or off-message content. Getting over (managing) that barrier is one of the toughest challenges I can see for them.</p>
