<blockquote><p>In this talk, using real Apollo video footage and a series of simple demonstrations, we will take a closer look at the science behind "moon hoax" claims, and ask whether we really did land on the Moon.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, I don't know about you but I'd sure like to find out :-)</p>
