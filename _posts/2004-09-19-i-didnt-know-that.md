<p>The expression <em>&#8216;hoist on his own petard'</em> comes from the frequent and generally grisly end of <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/tx4/bustersbattery/militrivia/MILITRIVIA58.html">His Majesty's Petardier</a>&#8212;from the French, <em>&#8220;person who has to light a very large fire-cracker at point-blank range while standing under boiling oil in a haze of arrows and musket balls&#8221;</em>. The purpose of the petard was&#8212;at least in theory&#8212;to blow a bloody great hole in a castle door (6-inch-thick, two-hundred-year-old-oak beams held together with cast iron straps etc. you know, that sort of thing) and it was ignited like a cannon (ie by standing next to it and lighting a fuse).</p>
