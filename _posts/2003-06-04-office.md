<p>Have just moved Pumpernickle into desk space at an architecture practice called muf. Their <a href="http://www.muf.co.uk/">web site</a> has this to say about them:</p>

<p><q> muf is a collaborative practice of art and architecture committed to public realm projects which embed enduring and unexpected interventions in the physical and social fabric of the urban environment.</q></p>

<p>The office is very cool and makes a welcome change to some of the other nasty places Pumpernickle has lay its hat. In particular, the workers seem to happily coexist in a superficially chaotic environment and there is little emphasis placed on computers--nice to be someplace where people stay up late cutting, pasting and gluing bits of paper.</p>

<p>I quote the muf 'mission statement' above as I find that--curiously--it resonates nicely with what Pumpernickle would like to be doing, where the 'architecture' is 'digital production'. In a sense, the Lecturelist project that we are currently developing for <a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/">Billy</a> aims to be an "unexpected intervention" into a virtual urban lifestyle--an attempt to trigger some change of pattern in the behaviour of the urban millions (it's a cool project, check out <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org/">lecturelist.org</a>) and thus make a lasting impression on the cultural environment.</p>

<p>Now all James and I need to do is find some lovely government lolly to fund the next couple of big not-for-profit ideas ;-)</p>
