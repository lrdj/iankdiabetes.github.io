<p dir="ltr">I had an idea of how we could perhaps make the category pages a bit more fun and interesting. Instead of a strapline along the usual lines of 'come to Currys to buy a TV' we could put some funny/poignant quotes relating to the products. Examples like these I found on the web:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>TV</strong></p>
<p><em>Television! Teacher, mother, secret lover.</em> - Homer Simpson </p>
<p><strong>Computing</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>"Home computers are being called upon to perform many new functions, including the consumption of homework formerly eaten by the dog."</em> - Doug Larson</p>
<p><em>"Computing is not about computers any more. It is about living."</em> - Nicholas Negroponte</p>
<p><strong>Data storage</strong></p>
<p><em>"Back up my hard drive? How do I put it in reverse?"</em> - Author Unknown</p>
<p><strong>PC software</strong></p>
<p><em>"In God we trust, all others we virus scan</em>." - Author Unknown</p>
<p><strong>Internet communications</strong></p>
<p><em>"The Internet? Is that thing still around?"</em> - Homer Simpson</p>
<p><strong>iPods</strong></p>
<p><em>"I get the shuffle and then I shuffle the shuffle."</em> - US President George W Bush</p>
<p><strong>Cooking and Kitchen</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>"The kitchen is a country in which there are always discoveries to be made."</em> - Grimod de la Reyni√®re (1758-1838)</p></font></font><br />
