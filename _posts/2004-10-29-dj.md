<p>Wow, more DJ spam. I must be the new hub of the online music scene. It&#8217;s the ususal enchanting copy, <em>connecting their minds to their bodies</em> I mean who writes this stuff ;-)</p>

<blockquote><p>Luca Ricci is a talent to be watched. His sound and style make him a favourite anywhere he plays. His music has taken clubbers on a voyage - connecting their minds to their bodies with the drum beats as their guide.</p></blockquote>

<p>For booking: <a href="mailto:%6D%61%69%6C%74%6F%64%6A%62%6F%6F%6B%69%6E%67%40%68%6F%74%70%6F%70%2E%63%6F%6D">djbooking@hotpop.com</a></p>

<p>and I love the way the emails always end with a hopeful 'bookings' email address. If this keeps up, I'll be taking bookings for <a href="http://www.misskittin.com/">Kittin</a> ;-)</p>
