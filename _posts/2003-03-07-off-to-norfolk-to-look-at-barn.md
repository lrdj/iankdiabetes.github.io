<p>Considering a partial downshift in the property ladder game. We've seen this gorgeous converted barn on three acres smac on the Norfolk Broads. I can build a solar-powered studio and have a boat (nice dream, anyway). Now all we need to sort is the small problem of east Anglia drifting under the North Sea...</p>
