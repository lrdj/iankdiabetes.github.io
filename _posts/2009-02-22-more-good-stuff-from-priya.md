<p>Another great deck from <a href="http://www.priyascape.com/">Priya</a>. I particularly love the simple needs matrix on slide 6, "Search topologies" which leads into the presentation of the three key experiences. </p>

<p>I'm looking for ways to map value to experience and when the needs matrix is simple enough, a nice one-to-one relationship between need and UI benefit works well. That said, when your needs matrix goes bonkers (how big was your last corporate intranet needs matrix) it gets harder to map one-to-one...</p>

<p>The search for scalability continues apace :-)</p>
