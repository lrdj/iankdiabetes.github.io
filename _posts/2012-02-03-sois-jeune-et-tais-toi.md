<p>Had company drinks last night and met a nice man from France. I was explaining how my family moved to paris in 1968 and it turns out he was six years old at the time of the summer <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mai_68">événements</a>. My family lived in the quiet western suburb of Vaucresson, 10 kilometres from Notre-Dame and as a five-year old trying to get to grips with a new school, a  new language and new friends I let the events pass without noticing.</p>

<p>Turns out this guy lived in the Quartier Latin and had barricades on his doorstep! He remembers the sights and smells to this day. The confusion, overturned Renault Dauphines, benches and bins piled high, paving stones pried up for use as projectiles. One of his most vivid memories is students turning the Luxembourg Gardens into open-air debating chambers...</p>

<p>Anyhow, always loved this print, the silhouette in the background doing the censorship is of course the Général de Gaulle who was running the country at the time.</p>
