<p>Ok, so I guess Greg Landweber and Arlo Rose got tired of learning new tricks. To be fair, <a href="http://www.kaleidoscope.net">Kaleidoscope</a> was (and is) one of coolest Mac OS hacks. It allowed people to completely change the look-and-feel of their machine by using themes.</p>

<p>Kaleidoscope won't be upgraded to OS X which in a way is to be expected as since the two desktops use completely different methods to describe stuff&mdash;it would be a rewrite from scratch and the guys are probably busy with their day jobs.</p>

<p>So getting to the point already, I wanted to say thanks to <a href="http://www.conundrumsoft.com">conundrum software</a> for sorting out the theme thing on OS X and letting me use the super functional Pez theme that I used to run under Kaleidoscope. Give it a month or two, then download (and pay for) version 4 of Duality. It'll be the first theme switcher on X to catch errors and prevent you messing up your system. Also, it will ship with a companion app that cleans up old themes, so the choice available should grow considerably at a stroke:-)</p>

<p>Their site is pretty slow and often down unfortunately (popularity?). Finally, if somebody knows of an OS X version of the "slibber" theme (you'll know it if you use it) I'd be mighty grateful for a url.</p>
