<p>I've been getting news of display problems. Apparently, these pages are not completely rendering in <span class="caps">IE5 </span>mac and <span class="caps">IE5W</span>in98. I'm having a hard time isolating the problem, so/05/have to revert to a cheesier stylesheet that I'm pretty sure works ok...</p>

<p>Before I do, if anyone out there can reproduce the bug in a consistent way, I'd appreciate it if you dropped me <a href="mailto:dug@pumpernickle.net">a note</a>.</p>
