<p>Interesting article over at <a href="http://mobileopportunity.blogspot.com/2009/09/is-apple-too-powerful.html">mobileopportunity</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Jobs said <em>There's a big new market, and we want in</em> Not, <em>we're creating something new</em> or <em>we can vastly improve this category</em> Just, <em>we want a cut</em> </p>

<p>It sounds like something Don Corleone would say. Or Steve Ballmer. But it's not what I expected from Apple...</p></blockquote>

<p>Michael Mace makes a number of good points and takes a good look at the potential clash between Pure Digital and Apple. All true, but the thing I take out of it is what's the point of a system that needs to contain its success?</p>

<p>Or put another way, if every time a capitalist succeeds in getting enough capital to knock out the competition we have to go in and manually adjust the market doesn't that suggest something fundamentally daft with capitalism?</p>

<p>Which got me thinking about whether we can teach innovation and fine art and colleges and stuff but I'll have a think about that later...</p>

<p>Oh. and just so I remember, #interesting2009 was bloody brilliant. I laughed (lots) I cried (twice) and came away happy and exhausted :-)</p>
