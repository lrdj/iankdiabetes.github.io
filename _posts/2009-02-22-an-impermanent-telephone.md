<p>Love this green handset concept from <a href="http://www.thegreenergrass.org/2008/02/linc-lifecycle-concept-phone.html">greenergrass</a></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="LINC green handset concept" src="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/LINC.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="caps">LINC </span>is a typical touch screen smart phone with all the connectivity and features you come to expect. Its got a cell phone, a media player, a web browser, <span class="caps">GPS, </span>downloadable content, Bluetooth, wifi, the latest 3G network. But here's the catch. <span class="caps">LINC </span>is leased to the user as a service, not a product.</p></blockquote>

<p>Love it. You don't own it, you live with it for a while and then it gets morphed into something else once your new <span class="caps">LINC </span>has arrived in the post (in its green packaging, of course).</p>
