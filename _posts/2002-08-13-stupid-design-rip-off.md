<p><a href="http://www.w3b-ink.com/">This fucking idiot</a> has grabbed large chunks of the Pumpernickle site (including the basic <span class="caps">XHTML </span>template) both code and design and has 'pre' dated the stuff and claims it as his own. It's unbelievable, he's so bold, he's even left my style calls and comments in the (renamed) stylesheets!</p>

<p>I don't know wether to laugh or cry <strong>grrrr</strong></p>

<p>Compare:<br /> <a href="http://www.pumpernickle.net/scripts/transLibA.js">my file</a></p>

<p>and:<br /> <a href="http://www.w3b-ink.com/scripts/alcofree.js">his file</a></p>

<p>He has now taken down his js file. However, I thought I'd post a copy of <a href="http://www.pumpernickle.net/scripts/alcofree.js">his file</a> for posterity.</p>

<p>I'm gonna lynch the little fucker:-(((</p>
