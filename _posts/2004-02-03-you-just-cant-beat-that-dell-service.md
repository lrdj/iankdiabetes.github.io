<p>It's amazing how right Apple gets it when it gets it right :-)</p>

<p><span class="caps">UPS </span>guy arrives the day after I call. He's clutching a bundle of special Apple paperwork, complete with printed instructions. He knows all my details and has brought me all the documentation I need to safely send my iBook <span class="caps">AND </span>the most awesome specially designed packaging, specifically designed to safely guard Powerbooks and iBooks in transit.</p>

<p><span style="float:right;"> He fills in the paperwork&hellip;<br /> <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/logboard1.jpg"><img src="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/logboard1_tn.jpg" alt="Click to enlarge (ups man)" width="160" height="120" style="border:1px solid #ccc;margin:4px 0 0 0;padding:0;" /></a> </span></p>

<p>He packs your computer for you&hellip;<br /> <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/logboard2.jpg"><img src="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/logboard2_tn.jpg" alt="Click to enlarge (box)" width="160" height="120" style="border:1px solid #ccc;margin:4px 0 0 0;padding:0;" /></a></p>

<p>And closes and seals the box.</p>

<p>It's like you've time-warped to 1958--OK he doesn't salute you when he leaves, but pretty darn close.</p>

<p>Just fantastic :-)</p>
