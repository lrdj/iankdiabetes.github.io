<p>Just installed <a href="http://www.fallon.com/">Fallon's</a> <a href="http://www.fallon.com/skimmer">Skimmer app</a> and as much as I'm uncomfortable with the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">Air</a> platform I'm really enjoying it. They set out to achieve a few simple goals and have pretty much succeeded.</p>

<p>No-one cares about this sort of stuff anymore, but I followed the links back to Fallon's website and was impressed by their tech+culture choices, they're getting really close to best-practice. The Skimmer app and the website both follow a similar look-and-feel but each makes use of its particular strong points.</p>

<h2>The website</h2>

<p>The website is built in reasonably semantic xhtml (except the multimedia insertions but hey, it's an ad agency) and not only does the code carry meaning, it validates! I only got one warning on the homepage for an unencoded <span class="caps">URL </span>path fragment. It's also almost accessible, also unusual for site in this space.</p>

<p>The javascript library is jQuery (of course) but an added clue that someone there knows what they're doing is the library link to Google code instead of the webserver.</p>

<p>The blog pages are served up using a nicely made skin on top of Wordpress and video and images are served from good old Flickr and Youtube embeds just like Mom used to make 'em.</p>

<p>Both the website and the desktop app are trying hard to fit closely with the frequent webuser. The diggerati and the road warrior, the <span class="caps">MBP </span>brigade already twittering-up a storm about <span class="caps">SXSW </span>would feel welcome and respected. Hell, I bet even Cory Doctorow himself wouldn't mind checking out a couple Chrysler ads in the "our work" section.</p>

<h2>The app (<a href="http://www.fallon.com/skimmer">download Skimmer here</a>)</h2>

<p>The desktop app is called "Skimmer" and its purpose is very simple. Aggregate a few key social networks allowing the user to both push and pull content. Once the content is in the app, suggest a connection with other Skimmer users to share content and status.</p>

<p>In one sense this is really no big deal. What I like about the user experience is the clarity of the purpose and the honesty of the deliverable. </p>

<p>I would have preferred a bit more feedback when loading assets (and come to think of it, someone needs to tell that designer about colour contrast and visibility) and would have preferred either a web pureplay or a cocoa app but I can't deny the experience is on the whole very impressive.</p>

<h2>The Slideshare (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/akispicer/fallon-brainfood-skimmer-the-social-v0405d2">watch the presentation</a>)</h2>

<p>Finally, if i was a client looking to better understand how my digital media spend was going to loop back to <span class="caps">ROI</span> I'd be comforted by the whole experience of the Fallon planning team. </p>

<p>They built these digital assets with the best intentions (participating in internet culture to benefit from it--sound familiar?) but the case study should help help put a client's mind at ease. They're showing they understand basic tracking and monitoring and have demonstrated the quality of their digital planning in the process.</p>

<p>If I was still in agencyland I'd be blogging my little heart about this case study;-)</p>
