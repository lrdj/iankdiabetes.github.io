<p>Tom Hough recently commented on <a href="/le_enraged_mutton/is_bt_shit_as_well.html">an older post</a> about <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BT.</span></span></p>

<p>As with a lot of the &#8220;enraged mutton&#8221; posts, it was a bit of a venting session, but I&#8217;ll reprint the BT phone number here. I can&#8217;t garantee it&#8217;s still live, but here goes nothing;-)</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;a very nice lady called Alita calls you and gives you a phone number (an 0800 number no less) that gets you straight through to customer care&#8212;no queue, no delay, no option-3, just straight through to the nice lady.</p>

<p>So got a problem with BT? Need to vent? Here&#8217;s the number:</p>

<p>0800 800 871</p>

<p>That ends this public service announcement&#8230;</p></blockquote>
