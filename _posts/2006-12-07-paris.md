<p>So I've been in Paris all week. I was here last week and will be here for three days next week. I'm so totally sad, I've been commuting out to the burbs on the <span class="caps">RER, </span>working all day and then coming back to the hotel and working the evenings as well. I've had to cancel my going to <a href="http://www.leweb3.com/">LesBlogs3</a> and have done no strolling around soaking up the sights, no catching up with folk, no doing Christmas shopping etc. all a bit weird really...</p>

<p>Anyhow, I haven't had a mo to publish much and I've been grabbing the odd snap en passant but the Shozu uploader is disabled in roaming mode to prevent me having more bandwidth-related punch-ups with mobile phone companies. Normal picture stream behaviour resumes Friday night (geolocation by <a href="http://www.plazes.com">Plazes</a>).</p>
