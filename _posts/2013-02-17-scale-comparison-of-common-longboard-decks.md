<p>This is so awesome. One of the things that drives me nuts at longboard shops is how hard it is to compare relative board lengths. The comparison is made trickier as it's not just the size of the deck it's also the wheelbase options (how far apart the axels are set).</p>

<p>Interesting as well that true comparisons (ie ones that genuinely help the riding customer) are basically impossible at longboard shops as their ecommerce systems are designed to manage their stock, not the sum total of what available on the market.</p>

<p>They're saying it's a beta but I think <a href="http://longboardism.com">Longboardism</a> has really nailed it:-) <a href="http://loadsofdecks.com/page/2/?sortby=small">http://loadsofdecks.com</a></p>
