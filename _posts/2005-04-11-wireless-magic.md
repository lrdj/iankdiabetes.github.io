<p>Sitting in the car outside my flat typing this. Thank you open 802.11 networks :-)</p>

<p>p.s. Needed to be at home today but had to hide from <span class="caps">CLF </span>who isn't in school 'til this afternoon</p>

<p>p.p.s It's amazing how cold the inside of a parked car can get (am in my slippers)</p>
