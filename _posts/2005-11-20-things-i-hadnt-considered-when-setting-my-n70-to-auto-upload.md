<p>I've been using <a href="http://www.shozu.com/">ShoZu</a> to seamlessly upload my <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nseries/index.html?loc=inside%2Cmain_n70&amp;lang=en&amp;country=R1"><span class="caps">N70</span></a> pics to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bozo/">Flickr</a> which is cool up until the point you decide it's time for a large ebay sale...</p>
