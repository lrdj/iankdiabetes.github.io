<p>You know, Billy and I have been really struggling to keep <a href="http://lecturelist.org/">The Lecture List</a> afloat for some time now, and we're doing it because we believe in it (the problem of course is it's impossible to get funding for a thing with no revenue stream...)</p>

<p>Anyway, people keep signing up and we know a bunch of people use it which is of course great. I mention this because every now and then (like when Billy got very drunk and bought Madona's tights) something fun happens that gives us a wee boost.</p>

<p>One such boost came our way just now when we were shopping for stuff for <span class="caps">CLF'</span>s birthday treasure hunt in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9ret">Ceret</a> and Billy checked his mail in the local internet caf√©. To cut a long ramble short, Alex James told Ohna, Billy's wife that we could have some tickets to a thing he's doing next week and we just got confirmation from the publisher that it was OK to offer the tickets as a competition on the Lecture List.</p>

<p>So there you go, if you want some tickets, get yourself over to the Lecture List and answer the question:-)<br />

<a href="http://www.lecturelist.org/content/view_lecture/4391">Alex James | a bit of a blur</a> is at Blackwells next week. The competition for free tickets is <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org">on the home page</a></p>
