<p>So that was fun, if utterly exhausting (started my day 06:00 on Friday and got into my hotel bed at 01:30 only to be kicked awake by little girl at 06:30--and it went downhill from there on the sleep front).</p>

<p>So in brief, A'dam with a 2<sup>5/6</sup>-year-old:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.9292ov.nl/">trams</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/">museums</a></li>
<li>and a <a href="http://www.artis.nl/">zoo</a></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>back to work...</p>
