<p>Wow, sure I love Jason as much as the next guy but <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3434-a-loose-rant-on-maximization">this</a> really really resonated...</p>

<blockquote><p>Do I want to make things better? All the time. But do I want to maximize "betterness"? No thanks.<br />
I don't mind leaving some water in the cloth, some drips in the glass, some money on the table. I like knowing there's headroom. And once in a while it's a fun challenge to chip away at that headroom. But that's not for maximization's sake - it's for curiosity's sake. "Can we do it?" is a lot more interesting to me than "we must do it because that's what you're supposed to do."<br />
Having fun, exploring ideas, creating, solving, building great things for you and your customers, being proud of your work, challenging yourself, learning, growing, building a self-sustaining company on your own schedule, adding something useful to the world, and working with great people - that's what this is all about. Not maximization of a metric.</p></blockquote>
