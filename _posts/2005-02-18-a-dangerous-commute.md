<p>So yesterday, as the train was about five minutes out of Basingstoke...</p>

<blockquote><p>[intercom:] Is there a doctor or a nurse on the train? If there is a doctor or a nurse on the train, could they report to the last carriage immediately?</p></blockquote>

<p>...and just now, on the platform in Andover...</p>

<blockquote><p>[intercom:] If there is a young person called Felicity Mason on the train could she please leave the train now. Felicity Mason should leave the train in Andover.</p></blockquote>

<p>I hope yesterday's heart attack survived and that Felicity was just held up at school.</p>

<p>(15:57, three stations later, another call for Felicity Mason--the guard is going to walk the train--God I have no idea who this person is but i really hope she's all right. I can imagine her Mum waiting in Andover and slowly falling apart as she waits for news...)</p>
