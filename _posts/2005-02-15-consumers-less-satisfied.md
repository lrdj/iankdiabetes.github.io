<p>I just got a link to <a href="http://www.clickz.com/news/article.php/3483231">a slightly strange article</a> over on Clickz. It's titled <em>Consumers Less Satisfied With eBay and Amazon</em> and goes into some depth explaining how big e-retailers are diluting their initially focused product offering and how this in turn is damaging their customer relationships:</p>

<blockquote><p>"E-retail is undergoing a fundamental shift as some of the industry heavyweights move away from their core focus," said Larry Freed, chief executive of ForeSee Results, which commissioned the study. "Some of the best-known brands are changing business models and changing relationships with their customers. It's tough to do that without eroding satisfaction."</p></blockquote>

<p>I guess this is pretty sound business thinking, but I have to say I think eBay's popularity with customers is also waning because their support totally sucks. </p>

<p>Let me explain. You start your relationship with eBay on a high note and all goes well until some pre-teen troll gives you a negative rating, somebody doesn't pay for that hair-dryer or you get hit by unwanted bidders and need to filter your bids to ensure your product gets to the right bidder.</p>

<p>Try doing any of the above with the standard eBay interface and you'll quickly go mental. I would explain in detail, but <a href="http://www.ok-cancel.com/about.html">Kevin Cheng and Tom Chi</a> have already nailed it in <a href="http://www.ok-cancel.com/archives/week_2005_01_21.html">this fantastic cartoon</a>. I've not had first-hand experience of Amazon's 'help' desk but I wouldn't be surprised to find it uses the same "Cut and Paste Droids" who don't read your question or try and respond...</p>
