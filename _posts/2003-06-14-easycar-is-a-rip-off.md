<p>Just thought I'd share with the world that I am about to be fucked up the arse by Stelios Haji-Ioannou.</p>

<p>I'm feeling fairly outraged having just had a very circular conversation with the duty manager at their call centre. Basically, Easycar isn't easy and it certainly isn't cheap. So my advice would be read the terms and conditions very carefully (as they will be quoted back to you when you complain). Right, am off to write the ombudsman if I can find one.</p>
