<p>Wey hey, a sim unlock for iPhone is on it's way... <span class="caps">DVD</span> John has already made an <a title="So sue me ｻ Blog Archive ｻ iPhone Independence Day" href="http://nanocr.eu/2007/07/03/iphone-without-att/">activation server</a> so network-free landscape iPods might be just around the corner...</p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see how mobile operators react to this. As consumers try and create increased value with the iPhone by making it work the way they want it to the trad operators could feel a little threatened. Most of them are still focusing their business on 'offers' rather than building value creation networks with their customers.</p>

<p>I'm still waiting for the operator that lets me build my own billing plan. Any takers?</p>
