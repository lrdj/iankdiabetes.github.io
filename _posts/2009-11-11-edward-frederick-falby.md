<p>Well <span class="caps">CLF, </span>well H, the time has come again to think about Edward Falby. The googlemaps StreetView doesn't go down Lewisham High Street so the above image is the closest I've come to his memorial in his home parish.</p>

<p>Hal, you're still a bit too young to understand this, but your middle name is Edward in recognition of this man. I believe there are a number of Falby's out there carrying the names Edward and Frederick, I guess many of them are in honour of this man.</p>

<ul>
<li>Second Lieutenant <span class="caps">EDWARD FREDERICK FALBY </span>of the 1/4th battalion The Loyal North Lancashire Regiment died on 9 September 1916, aged 26.</li>
<li>He is remembered on the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme and on the war memorial at St Saviour's church, Lewisham High Street.</li>
<li>He was the son of Frederick and Mary Falby, of 65, Eltham Road, Lee. He attended St Olave's grammar school from 1904 - 1908.</li>
</ul>

<p>These few fragments are all I know of Edward but perhaps some day we we'll visit <a href="http://lewishamwarmemorials.wikidot.com/memorial:lewisham-st-saviour-and-st-john-rc-war-memorial">this memorial in Lewisham</a> together. </p>

<p>Perhaps you guys will find out a bit more in years to come.</p>
