<p>From the Flickr news page <a href="http://www.flickr.com/news.gne">entry dated 31st July, 2005</a> </p>

<blockquote><p>Now you can block obnoxious, unfriendly, annoying, suspicious, smelly, confusing, politically questionable, disconcerting, pernicious, creepy, putrid, dismaying ex-boyfriends, people who want to be your boyfriend who you don't want as a boyfriend, hamsters, people who dislike Mogwai, that girl who laughed at your hair extensions, insurance salesmen, your ex-husband's second wife, your ex-wife's second husband, turtles, astronauts, nose-pickers, people with ugly anime characters as their buddy icon or just about any people you would like to block. </p>

<p>Sometimes life is complicated.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes indeed it is. While there's no denying the <em>Flickreens</em> have some awesome copywriting skills, could this have something to do with Yahoo's legal department?</p>
