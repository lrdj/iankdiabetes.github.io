<p>We're off to the National Gallery to show <span class="caps">CLF </span>the disputed Samson and Delila. Recently, a work was attributed to Rubens and <a href="http://www.shareholder.com/bid/news/20020712-84694.cfm">sold for a huge pile of cash</a>. Ever since then, the experts have been haggling about the attribution. Personally, I think <cite>The Massacre of the Innocents</cite> looks nothing like Rubens - some of the compositional aspects (the figures at the rear-left-hand-side) don't look too well worked out. Rubens made extensive oil sketches before finalising a large work, I don't see any sign of that experimentation or research. Another giveaway (tho I've never had anyone agree with me on this one...) is that <span class="caps">PPR </span>couldn't paint breasts. His women look like men with two oranges pasted on their front. Now, at the time, the life-models <em>were</em> all men, it's just that most artists of the time could interpret the different body. Hell, most of <span class="caps">PPR'</span>s women have adam's apples;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, I've always thought the Samson looks like a 'real' Rubens, and what a nice way to spend an afternoon:-)</p>
