<p>I have been sleeping days all week. It's the only way to be 'fresh' for use of the broadband connection without workmen hammering and drilling... I've developed a rash and am wondering when <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/media/west_wing/sorkin.html">The West Wing's</a> Sam and Ainsley are finally going to have their earth-moving sexual encounter. Spent most of today over at Billy's house. Sat in the bath for an hour and then slept on the grass getting sunburned for two or three.</p>

<p>It's amazing how debilitating not having a bathroom can be.</p>

<p>I was about to hit the "send" button (these notes are posted via email) when I remembered the Seven-of-Nine and Janeway love stories... I'm guessing it's mostly women who write this stuff, so Aisnley and Sam sounded like a good candidate. A quick Google later and <a href="http://westwingstories.com/archive/stories/c-e/eb_IntensiveCare.htm">voil&agrave;</a></p>

<blockquote><p><i>I love you, Ainsley Hayes. I love that you never let up, I love that you're passionate about what you believe in, I love how you were with Theresa and Paloma, how you and Mom are with one another.</p>

<p>Sam, People are staring at us. I think they want us to board so they can take off.</p>

<p>They're staring?</p>

<p>Uh huh,</p>

<p>Then let's give them something to look at.</i></p>

<p>Sam grabbed her and pulled her close for an earth shattering kiss.</p>

<p><i>There's going to be <span class="caps">TALK,</span> Sam, </i>she said when he broke the kiss.</p>

<p><i>Do you care?</p>

<p>Let's give them something to talk about.</i></p>

<p>Ainsley grabbed his tie and pulled him in for another tender kiss. Eventually, they boarded the plane to thunderous applause.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ahhh...</p>
