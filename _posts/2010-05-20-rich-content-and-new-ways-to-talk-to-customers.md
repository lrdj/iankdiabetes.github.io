<p>I have been meeting with some different companies recently looking at ways we can increase the benefit of the content on our sites for our users. </p>

<p>There were many interesting things I looked at including product tours, interactive buyer's guides, presenter led content, branded editorial and complete TV channels online. </p>

<p>Below are a snapshot of some of the different things discussed. Check them out and let me know your thoughts on them:</p>

<p><object style="height:400px; width: 535px"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8cmlx9LJbE0" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8cmlx9LJbE0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="535" height="400"></embed></object></p>

<p>Coast Productions produced some really engaging content for Canon as parted of a brand campaign that involved taking competition winners to do dream photo shoots with a professional photographer in some incredible locations. Check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/assignmenttutorials">the results</a></p>

<p>Adjust Your Set are the people behind <span class="caps">M&amp;S</span> TV and have created the 12 channels for their current allocation. Here are <a href="http://www.marksandspencer.com/MS-TV/b/311612031?ie=UTF8&amp;intid=gnav_ms-tv&amp;ie=UTF8">some interesting videos</a></p>

<p>Gate Web Video do a range of presenter led content, using a presenter to talk users through all aspects of their journey, embedding the presenter onto the page. See what you think and <a href="http://gatewebvideo.co.uk/">have a look at their showreel</a></p>

<p>We also had a pitch from Dennis for producing an interactive magazine for helping with Buyer's Guides and distributing content online. Here is their pitch work, a basic <a href="http://dennis.cerosmedia.com/1O4be929e4f0363198.cde">magazine on imaging</a></p>
