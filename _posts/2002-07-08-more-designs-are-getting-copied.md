<p>apparently, and <a href="http://www.plagiarism.org/">these people</a> want to help students avoid it. You'd think that a site called Plagiarism.org might try and make a more unique logo. I mean it's a logo with a swoosh(!):</p>

<p><img src="http://www.plagiarism.org/images/plag_logo.gif" width="223" height="53" hspace="5" vspace="10" /></p>

<p>The ultimate reference for swoosh logos is probably <a href="http://50cups.com/swoosh/ballandswoosh.asp">swoosh no more</a> and of course the seminal <a href="http://www.enormicom.com/04.html">enormicom</a> created by <a href="http://www.37signals.com/18.html">37signals</a> who brought us that imortal line <cite>Complete sentences are so <span class="caps">Q4'99.</span> That's why your new brand includes its very own three word tagline.</cite></p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.v-2.org/articles/swooshtika.html">v-2.org</a> have a lengthier piece on the subject of the march of the swoosh (but lots of goofy flash navigation).</p>
