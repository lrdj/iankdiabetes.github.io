<p>Well it's been a week now and Hal is eating non-stop (even makes sucking noises in his sleep, Nick's nipples are taking a serious battering) and developing well. <s>Last night</s> early this morning I had a session with him and he managed to look me in the eyes. His limbs are still all folded up and we're swaddling him, but I'm guessing (because my memory of <span class="caps">CLF </span>as a baby has been erased by her growing up...) he'll limber up soon.</p>

<p>It's funny having a cesearian baby, when he came out, his head wasn't squashed (CLF came out looking like a butternut squash) and a couple of skull plates were lined up in preparation for the big squeeze. Over the last few days, the plates have settled down and he now has a perfectly formed wee head.</p>

<p>Another thing I'm experiencing differently to when I was caring for <span class="caps">CLF </span>is beeing peed on. I was warned about the 'little fountain' concept and was ready with a strategically positioned wipe when he went for it. Of course the other difference is the guy has a huge, uncut cock. His testicles are like ping pong balls! This whole boy thing is going to take a little getting used to...</p>
