<p>Well, I feel a whole lot better now that the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">White House website</a> is covered with pictures of the sensitive couple hugging refugees...</p>

<p>Anyway, I was reading <a href="http://knittinglibran.blogspot.com/">some</a> <a href="http://www.skinnyrabbit.com/">knitting</a> <a href="http://www.masondixonknitting.com/">sites</a> (as you do) that last one described how lots of folk are donating knitting and sending cash to the red Cross.</p>

<p>Sounded like a good idea, what with children <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4207944.stm">bunking-up with cadavers</a> in the heartland of freedom so I went on over to the Red Cross site and donated some dollars.</p>

<p>If you're feeling the same, the place you need to go to is here:<br />
<a href="https://secure2.convio.net/arc/site/Donation?ACTION=SHOW_DONATION_OPTIONS&amp;CAMPAIGN_ID=1121&amp;JServSessionIdr010=5eac9ahwf1.app28b">http://www.redcross.org/</a></p>

<p>A nice feature they have enabled is to make your donation a tribute or a memorial.</p>

<p>I took the liberty of making mine a tibute to the The George W. Bush Emergency Preparedness Award</p>

<p>Of course, I asked that the letter of confirmation be sent to:</p>

<p>George W. Bush<br />
The White House<br />
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW<br />
Washington, DC 20500</p>

<p>So that an impersonal, mail-opening computer can chuck it in the bin. No but seriously, maybe you're not a sarcky liberal like me, maybe you've lost someone dear in a similar event or even to Katrina herself. Whatever the case, you should make your donation a tribute to something you care about and send the notice to George.</p>
