This was posted by Mike, the guy who wrote Kablog (I think). It's still a beta, but very promising, and gives your thumb a whole new set of activities. Still much harder to use and a lot more complex than the Cognima Snap application I've been testing, but the xmlrpc hook into Movable type is very, very powerful, so expect a host of how-did-they-do-that apps in the moblogging category:-)</p></blockquote>
