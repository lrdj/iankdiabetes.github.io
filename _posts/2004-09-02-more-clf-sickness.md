<p>Having a 13.4 kilo little girl sound asleep on your left shoulder from 17:30 to 18:30 while trying to not wake her up and pick up her medicine from the pharmacy at the same time does wonders for your muscle tissue;-)</p>

<p><span class="caps">CLF </span>now has eardrops to add to the fun--she is OK and currently asleep. This could go on another couple of days according to the doc.</p>
