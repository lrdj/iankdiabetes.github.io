<p>As I mentioned before, a nice <span class="caps">UPS </span>man took my iBook away to be mended under Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/support/ibook/faq/">iBook Logic Board Repair Extension Programme</a></p>

<p>It came back all shiny and new less than a week later :-)</p>

<p>It blew up again a week after that :-(</p>

<p>We've just been through the bipolar <span class="caps">UPS </span>man circuit again (the circuit, not the <span class="caps">UPS </span>man) and are currently hoping if it does go wrong again, it'll happen under the 90 day repair warrantee.</p>

<p>Fingers all very crossed...</p>
