<p>Darn, this is one serious roller-coaster ride ;-) What happened today is only just becoming clear now (at 17:17 - twelve and a half hours after we thought Nick went into labour). What actually happened, was that Nicki contracted some quite potent tummy bug (probably from her friend Alison's mother-in-law who came down from Scotland with a bug) and the pains were the aches of violent food poisoning (imagine violent vomiting and endless diarrhea, body temperature all over the place - not nice, but for someone due in a few days, easy to mistake for Labour).</p>

<p>Well, nothing is definite, but we're monitoring the situation closely (in case it <em>was</em> labour).</p>
