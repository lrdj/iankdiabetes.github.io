<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I've spent a few minutes looking at a typical user flow from the point of view of a comparison shopper and wanted to share some thoughts based on landing pages. In this case <a href="http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/washing-machines/332_3119_30206_xx_xx/xx-criteria.html?sPageInfo=1_30&amp;srcid=198&amp;tag=washing_machines_gen&amp;xtor=SEC-12-GOO&amp;mctag=gg_goog_7904&amp;gclid=CIX5zZf0sKICFYyT3wodSQxv6w">Washing machines</a></p>

<p>A user lands on a generic listing page of relevant products which succeeds in the first golden rule--answer the question!</p>

<p>Some thoughts I had for the future, maybe in conjunction with a <span class="caps">MVT </span>integration, would be to make the page stickier for comparison shoppers and provide more reasons to purchase with {brand} and not another site.</p>

<p>Whilst most shoppers may compare by price alone, it's worth considering other emotions involved in the buying psyche.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why book with {brand}? <span class="caps">USP</span>s provide the user reasons to use your brand, beyond price alone.These may be reputation, product offering etc.</li>
<li>Comprehensive guides. Positioning yourself as a expert in an area will create confidence in your customer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond these fairly simple quick wins, I've listed a few ideas for landing pages which may be worth considering as you see fit.</p>

<ul>
<li>Incorporate reviews / review score into listing--customers can quickly establish high performing products.</li>
<li>Allow the customer to filter their results further. These could extend to review score, home delivery, reserve and collect etc</li>
<li>Cross-sell relevant items (ie) tumble dryers with washing machines</li>
<li>Competitor pricing--(one for legal) whether {brand} is cheaper or equal to your competitors pricing</li>
<li>Emphasis on urgency--There are {x} items left "order now to avoid disappointment"</li>
</ul>

<p>Just a few more observations, please use as you feel appropriate--you now the business better than I.</p>

<p>Darren</p>
