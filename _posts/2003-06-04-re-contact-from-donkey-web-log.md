Got this interesting comment in the post today re the Sony shock and awe story from <a href="http://www.out-law.co.uk/php/page.php?page_id=sonywithdrawssho1050591709&amp;area=news">outlaw.com</a>

> hi dug--re your post on sony withdrawing application for 'shock &amp; awe' line--what i find offensive is that a modern-day president would use such a flippant, sensationalist, rabble-rousing phrase about his plans to invade another country. And that's whether you agree with the war or not - let's have a little decency and respect for the soldiers &amp; civilians on both sides, eh, and treat the subject with the solemnity that is due?

> sony using it? i have no problem with. it's the kind of phrase I would expect from a company making games. shame the media didn't focus on the original use of it, rather than the rehash.

I couldn't agree more. I had started writing a post about the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,966768,00.html">Salam Pax article</a> in The Guardian but found myself getting all frothed up again so decided to stop. In a nutshell, the interesting point of the article isn't so much that Salam is gay, or middle-class or even a geek--the beauty of the piece (and by extension his blog) is that it reminds us that Iraq is a proper country with decent, ordinary people who care about the same things we do and go about their lives in a broadly similar way to us. We invaded a sovereign nation, and there just isn't any way around that. Finally (as I've drifted a bit here) I just wanted to add that Catherine does not agree with me here and it isn't my intention to speak for her -- her point was about the behaviour of the US executive, not the right-or-wrong of the war itself...

Catherine has also reminded me that I need to fix the picture-uploader as I have no recent pics of CLF in the scrapbook -- Thanks Catherine:-)
