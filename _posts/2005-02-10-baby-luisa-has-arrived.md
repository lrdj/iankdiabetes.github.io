<p>The latest from Andy and Michaela :-)</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear All. </p>

<p>sorry for taking this short cut, but this is just to inform you that our new addition to the family has arrived in the early hours of Tuesday morning, February 8.  Luisa Katherina was in quite a hurry and we arrived at the hospital with only 25 minutes to spare. Most trips to the dentist last longer than that (not sure about the physical discomfort though), and both mother and baby were back home by 10.00 in the morning, when daughter No.1 greeted the new arrival with the classic phrase: Hello Babylu, would you like to do a puzzle with me? I guess we are truly blessed.</p>

<p>Best wishes<br />

<p>Congratulations !!!</p>
