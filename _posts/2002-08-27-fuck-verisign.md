<p>Just got a note from verisign telling me the pumpernickle domain was about to expire. This is interesting because I've now started the long slow painful migration away from the servants of Beelzebub and towards the light of an internic recommended registrar.</p>

<p>As of a few days ago, the whois db updated and pumpernickle.net is no longer with Verisign (woohoo!). Which of course doesn't answer the question of why they're still warning me about expiry dates.</p>

<p>And for those who missed the earlier post &mdash; I'm leaving verisign and you can too. Go <a href="http://www.internic.net/origin.html">here</a> to find a list of internic accredited registrars and make your move today:-)</p>
