<p>Mark from Bristol has pointed out to me that there's a link on the scrapbook that can be read in such a way as to give access to nudie pics of a fat hairy guy in the bath (me). I hope he hasn't also written down my credit card details if indeed they were also visible.</p>

<p>Which reminded me of a similarly unsettling moment where my mother-in-law was scrolling through my iPhoto library looking at pictures of her daughter and granddaughter and came across the extreme close-up pictures of her son-in-law's spotty penis (I came upon the idea of using the camera to examine a rash in my crotch--works well, but you have to remember to delete the pics from the iPhoto library).</p>

<p>Now <em>that's</em> embarrasing;-)</p>
