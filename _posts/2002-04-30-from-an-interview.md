<p>with the Lizards' David Cunningham September, 1984 </p>

<p><q> "It's just the Flying Lizards top ten favourite tunes. Not my personal favourites. This is terribly pretentious but I've always toyed with the idea that the Flying Lizards represented rock and roll from some sort of alternative universe. It amuses me to think of a possible universe where James Joyce is a really popular author." </q></p>

<p>Ahh to be young again... But did he foretell the current self-destruction of popular media as our screens fill to bursting with the top ten whatevers of all time ;-)</p>
