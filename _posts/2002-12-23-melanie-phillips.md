<p>Should be interesting to see how far <a href="http://www.cloudsoup.com/melanie.php">this</a> goes.</p>

<p>And can I just say, we've finally got a radio again. I can't believe I lived so long without the Donald Rumsfelf quote of the week...</p>

<p><q> The message is that there are no knowns. There are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns, that is to say there are things we now know we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns&mdash;things we do not know we don't know </q></p>

<p>- Donald Rumsfeld</p>
