<p>Well, very impressed by the free and so far very reliable wifi on the <span class="caps">GNER </span>train to Inverness. I was worried I'd need to be on one of the 'Mallards' to guarantee conectivity but no, things are working fine...</p>

<p>Makes a change from the Eurostar where everything is provided free in biz class. On <span class="caps">GNER </span>you have to buy your own coffee and the sandwiches are a bit on the grim side.</p>

<p>Makes me yearn for the old British Rail cooked breakfast. It was a model of solid silver and inefficiency (I think it took like four people to serve it) but darn what a way to start the day:-)</p>
