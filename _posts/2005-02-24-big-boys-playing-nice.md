<p>Well, Google is <a href="http://www.clickz.com/news/article.php/3485296">courting entertainment marketers</a> apparently. The piece explains how new Google film listings are making studio bosses nervous. There's some classic old-world thinking</p>

<blockquote><p>If I'm a movie studio, I'd want the official movie Web site to come up as a result, and I wouldn't want to pay for that. It makes me nervous that they're trying to be too much to everybody</p></blockquote>

<p>I bothered to read the article because I'm still forging ahead with my search for a new advertising. Actually, it's increasingly looking like the agencies are drinking the Cool-Aid and getting on with the new order. </p>

<p>For my part, I'm about half way through (and two weeks behind schedule) building a tool that will allow  entertainment marketers to tap their activity directly into their potential fan bases.</p>

<p>More on this one as it happens...</p>
