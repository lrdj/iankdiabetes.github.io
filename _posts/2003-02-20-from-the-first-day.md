<p>I was introduced to the silent operation, brilliant colours, high resolution, piezoelectric ink delivery printing system of Epson's printers things started to go wrong. Since then things have gotten gradually worse as I spend more and more cash on pointless ink cartridges all the while kicking myself for not buying a laser printer as I listen to yet another ink-gobbling head-clean...</p>

<p>Anyway, got this lovely note in the post today with a fantastic link to <a href="http://www.i18nguy.com/humor/epson-sucks.html">Epson sucks</a> Joy for Epson-haters everywhere...</p>
