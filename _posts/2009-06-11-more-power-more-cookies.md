<p>The unstoppable Johnnie Moore is <a href="http://www.johnniemoore.com/blog/archives/002215.php">at it again</a></p>

<p>I'm still running my "notice more, change less" mantra, I'm reminded of the simple power that come from taking time to see the subtle ways our lives are connected... something that eludes those who, for instance, still like to dismiss things like twitter as irrelevant chit-chat.</p>
