<p>Don't know if this was always the case and I just missed it, but the new version of photoshop has a nice refinement to the "Hue/Saturation" dialogue. When you click on "colorize", the hue you start with is based on the foreground colour. This means if you're making a bunch of tinted background graphics to match a site's colourways, you don't have to fiddle with the "hue" slider anymore (much).</p>

<p>Which is nice:-)</p>
