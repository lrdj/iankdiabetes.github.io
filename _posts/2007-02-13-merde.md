<p>Oh bugger, the fabulous Mom and Pop southwestern restaurant (renowned for snails, duck dishes and cassoulet) which by all acounts was always bustling and well worth the détour changed hands two years ago. Serve me right for not checking the dates on the website:-(</p>

<p>One look at the table setting should have warned me that the owners have only kept the name <em>Les Gourmands</em> out of irony...</p>
