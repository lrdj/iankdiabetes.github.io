<p>Apparently there is an acknowledged syndrome called <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PEAD</span></span>&#8212;pre-election anxiety disorder&#8212;the fear that one&#8217;s vote will not count. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it was sweeping the nation. With all the shenanigans going on to interfere with the democratic process, in any just world, Bush and his band of merry men would be found guilty of vote tampering and slammed in irons. The fact that there are teams of lawyers revving themselves up to challenge any result they don&#8217;t like&#8212;let alone voters on their way to cast their votes&#8212;it is nothing short of intimidation. </p>

<p>If this was Haiti or Indonesia there would be men in blue helmets and white toyotas hanging out outside the polling stations to make sure the elections are fairly conducted. It&#8217;s a bloody disgrace. Grrrrrr (incoherent, impotent rage)</p>

<p>So yeah. Go vote.</p>
