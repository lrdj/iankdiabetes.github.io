<p>Still waiting to hear back from Fnac (a great place to buy French stuff - iTunes licensing doesn't allow French 'variété' tracks on the UK store grr) re my <a href="/le_enraged_mutton/dispositif_anticopie_numarique.html">earlier note to them</a>.</p>

<p>Simply put, I was just about to order a disc when I noticed the digital rights protection label. I wrote in to say that while I'd love to purchase the album (Camille's <em>Le Fil</em>) I won't until they stock a non-drm version.</p>

<p>Sitting here fuming, found this fun piece on <a href="http://www.wheretheressmoke.net/2004/09/how_to_host_a_m.html">how to host a swapping party</a> which I'll forward to the manager when he writes back explaining that <em>home taping is killing music</em></p>

<p>So I guess I need to do another banner.</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic? "no drm"</li>
<li>Chatty? "Actually, I won't buy that"</li>
<li>Political? "Sharing is legal and <span class="caps">DRM </span>infringes your rights under copyright law" (wow, catchy, that one)</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyways, having a think...</p>
