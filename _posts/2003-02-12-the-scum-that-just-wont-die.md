<p>The following received at 23:07</p>

<p><q> Dear Network Solutions&reg; Customer, <br /> <br /> As a courtesy to our customers, we are sending this summary notification of the domain name that is due to expire in the coming year. When you renew today, you can take advantage of our best savings. Your registration for <span class="caps">BIGSAUCER.ORG </span>will expire on 08/12/03. Act now. </q></p>

<p>And then, an hour later (60 minutes in which to renew my domain)...</p>

<p><q> Dear Network Solutions Customer: <br /> <br /> We take every effort to protect you against unauthorized or fraudulent changes to your account. Therefore, we wanted to let you know that we have received a request to transfer your domain name, <span class="caps">BIGSAUCER.ORG, </span>to another registrar. <br /> <br /> If this is not a valid request, no action is necessary. Your domain name registration will not be changed. </q></p>

<p>It's bad enough they still hide the renewal confirmation with a double negative, they are now sending out automated renewal notices just before the confirm notice. Why is Verisign not in court? How can this be legal under American law?</p>
