<p>Darn, I've just this second dropped the last of my beautiful Salins-les-Bains coffee bowls:-( </p>

<p>Of course I've still got a bunch of coffee bowls but this particular crop of bowls dates back to my eighteenth summer when I worked as a runner on the Franco-American Films SA production of a 30-second spot for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banania">Banania</a> (The prop-master had bought a bunch of different bowls for the shoot and I was given the surplus ones).</p>

<p>Anyways, it's just a bit of crockery but for some reason I never thought I would break it. Funny to feel sad about a pot, but over the years, I've had many wonderful (mostly pyjama-clad) moments drinking steaming, milky coffee with friends...</p>
