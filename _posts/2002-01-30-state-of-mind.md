<p>This is the last week of/01/2002. Nicki (My wife) is six months pregnant with our first baby. I'm deep in a new-business struggle (If someone had told me I'd have to weather another recession I'd have laughed - what? twice in one lifetime, my gran only had 1929 to deal with...). My desk is piled high with paperwork and unfinished previous work, and to cap it all off, the limited company that owns my freehold has had all its Companies House deadlines arrive at once. Damn, how do I manage to appear so calm?</p>
