<p><a title="Apple says get a Mac" href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/">Apple says get a Mac</a>  So you know, I replaced my lovely 12" iBook with a lovely 12" powerbook back in 2006. Since then, I've travelled miles and miles on motorcycle and Eurostar and the whole time my mini workstation has been powering through... I tend to have Virtual <span class="caps">PC,</span> Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, Omnigraffle, <span class="caps">BBE</span>dit, three or four browsers and Omnioutline all running at the same time (while downloading podcasts and listening to iTunes) with snappy response and power to spare... </p>

<p>Now, I know that's no big deal in modern laptop terms but for me (as I create my own unique value in partnership with apple's products) it's both great and exactly what need. Unfortunately, everything is beginning to run on Intel macs, Adobe <span class="caps">CS3 </span>looks like Leopard only so if I upgrade I'm also gonna need a new system... add to that the running Windows without <span class="caps">VPC </span>and I really need to update my Powerbook.</p>

<p>So, dammit Steve, I thought you were going to anounce the new 12" powerbook last month, but nooooo, you had to go and do the Air&#8482; thing:-( </p>

<p>Steve, this is a machine I cannot use. For starters, I don't need thin, I need small. I need bounce-resistance (speed bumps and motorways) and I need crush-resistance (as I get kicked out of the conference room again and hastily stuff reports and coiled cables into my already overstuff laptop bag).</p>

<p>So where does that leave me...</p>

<p>I need a new laptop with an optical drive, an ethernet, an intel processor and a 12" form-factor. I need it soon, so if I can't get a 12" Powerbook, what are my options? I may actually have to <strong>shudder</strong> switch to a PC and go with a Dell or a Toshiba...</p>
