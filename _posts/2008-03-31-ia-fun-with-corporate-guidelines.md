<p><img alt="the 955 pixel grid" src="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/grid-thumb.jpg" width="370" height="277" /></p>

<p>I am currently looking at a guideline which reads:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>All sites must be resizable</li>
<li>User can select higher and lower resolution and layout must adapt</li>
<li>User must be able to resize font and layout must adapt accordingly</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>The next line reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>The grid is fixed and pages will be exactly 955 pixels with a 21/40 pixel step.</p></blockquote>

<p>So hum... the site is both fixed and flexible, not sure how to approach this one. I guess a slight distortion of the space-time continuum should let me produce a design that passes muster with the brand police... </p>

<p>Ah guidelines ;-)</p>
