<p>Just wanted to let you know that nine (9) letters and five months later, Orange has finally come clean.</p>

<p>They agree that their terms and conditions are unfair--they agree that it <em>is</em> ironic for them to be running an advertising campaign called "Fair"--and in consequence, they agree to fix my bill. They also agreed to review their <span class="caps">T&amp;C</span>s <em>and</em> are having an internal review about customer handling.</p>

<p>I'll package the correspondence up nicely for those letter-writing voyeurs out there when I get a mo.</p>
