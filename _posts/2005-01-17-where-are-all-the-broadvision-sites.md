<p>I used to spend a lot of time explaining to clients how powerful website personalisation was going to be for them and researching the technologies to do it. I remember one day, the people at Broadvision (a personalision software company) invited me to a seminar on the topic and showered me and a bunch of other agency folk with quality baked goods and average coffee.</p>

<p>Anyways, I was reminded of this last week when someone at work said something that sounded exactly like an old Broadvision pitch and we all laughed and got to thinking about what happened to all those amazing self-adjusting sites we going to build. In the end, they just didn't happen.</p>

<p>That was this Friday, and I just got my newsletter from OK/Cancel today. Tom Chi asks</p>

<blockquote><p>There was a period in the history of the web when personalization was going to transform <strong>everything</strong> -- making the buying experience vastly more inviting for customers and lucrative for business. I'm not really sure what happened.</p></blockquote>

<p>He's spot on as ever. Read <a href="http://www.ok-cancel.com/archives/post/2005/01/getting_personal.html">Getting Personal</a></p>
