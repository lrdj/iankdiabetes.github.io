<p>Just got this from Flickr...</p>

<blockquote><p>You may have heard on the grapevine that we planned to reward our dear Flickr members who bought a Pro Account in the early days. Well, it's true! And since you're one of those lovely people, here's a little something to say <span class="caps">YOU ROCK</span>!</p>

<ol>
<li>Double what you paid for! Your original 1 year pro account has been doubled to 2 years, and your new expiry date is Jan 4, 2007.</li>
<li>More capacity! Now you can upload 2 GB per month.</li>
<li>2 free Pro Accounts to give away to your friends! This won't be activated for a day or two, but when it is, you'll see a note on your home page telling you what to do. </li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you so much for putting your money where your mouth is and supporting us, even while we're in beta. Your generosity and cold, hard cash helped us get where we are today.</p>

<p>Kind regards,<br />
The Flickreenies.</p></blockquote>

<p>Goodness;-) The extra year sure is swell. Anyone need a free Pro account?</p>
