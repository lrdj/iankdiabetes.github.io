description: So HEF did his first code lesson today! He wants to jump forward to project #5 to make a game but hey, he's eight and has to start somewhere. Nice job General Assembly for the online learning tool Dash for passing the eight-year-old test. He struggled with some of the vocab whats a 'heading' Dad? but it was all straightforward enough to explain quickly. Great example of clear explanation -- The course uses a tag to explain attributes and values &lt;pizza size=&quot;large&quot; crust=&quot;thin&quot; type=&quot;pepperoni&quot;&gt; which HEF digested immediately. Nice one...
