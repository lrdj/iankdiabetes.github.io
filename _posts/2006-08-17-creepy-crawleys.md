<p>There is currently a spider hiding in my keyboard. He's wedged under the white panel the keys stick out of and is moving from beneath key to key. No amount of shaking or blowing seems to be able to convince him  my keyboard is not a good home.</p>

<p>In fact, as I type this, if I hit a key he is under he simply scampers over a few and settles in again.</p>

<p><span class="caps">OK...</span> This is slightly freaking me out here...</p>
