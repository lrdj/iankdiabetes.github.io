<p>An old chestnut found while digging around my bookmark file--Edward Tufte's analysis of the Columbia Shuttle report. He looks in detail at the meaning conveyed (or hidden) by the Boeing engineer's <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Rs&amp;topic_id=1&amp;topic=Ask%20E%2eT%2e">powerpoint presentation</a>. Worth a read, not only if you're a Tufte fan--chilling stuff...</p>
