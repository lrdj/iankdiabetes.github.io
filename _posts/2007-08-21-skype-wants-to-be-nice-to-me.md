<p>You know, I was gonna comment on the Skype blog <a title="Heartbeat" href="http://heartbeat.skype.com/">Heartbeat</a> (no, not on the bit where if they had decided to use computers equipped with a proper operating system their crash and subsequent total meltdown wouldn't have happened in the first place) (and no, not on the bit where for the same reason they can't manage a reliable single-customer view grrrr) no, I was going to comment on the email I received earlier today:</p>

<blockquote><p>As a goodwill gesture to all you faithful Skype Pro, Skype Unlimited, SkypeIn or Skype Voicemail customers, we're adding an additional seven days to your current subscription, free of charge.  And even if you didn't miss out on using Skype last week - you can still have a week free on Skype, on the house!</p></blockquote>

<p>So my first reaction is that </p>

<ol>
<li>customers that aren't those listed above can just fuck off</li>
<li>a customer worth building a relationship with is one that commits to a financial transaction with your brand. Gosh, how 80/20 nineteen-eighty-seven of you...</li>
</ol>

<p>But then I thought to myself, you just nicked the nine quid I had in my account three weeks ago. True, you did explain that you had to, and you did make it theoretically easy for me to protect my dosh while giving me ample and repeated fair warning.</p>

<p>But you know what, if you clean out the balance in your customer's accounts that's all they're gonna see.</p>

<p>Come on, this is sooooo not a modern approach to marketing. Your empty gesture has left me with exactly the same balance I had just before your meltdown--zero. </p>

<p>Niklas Zennström, you're a smart guy, my guess is you can do a lot better (and you can start by giving me my money back)</p>
