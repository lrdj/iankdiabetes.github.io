<p>I've been spending quite a lot of time looking at the British Museum website these past couple of months. I've nicked this graphic from <a href="http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/compass/ixbin/hixclient.exe?_IXDB_=compass&amp;search-form=graphical%2Fmain.html&amp;submit-button=search">Compass</a>, their editor-selected presentation of 5000 significant pieces from <a href="http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/">the main collection</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/compass/ixbin/hixclient.exe?_IXDB_=compass&amp;_IXFIRST_=1&amp;_IXMAXHITS_=1&amp;_IXSPFX_=graphical/full/&amp;$+with+all_unique_id_index+is+$=OBJ13492&amp;submit-button=summary"><img alt="See the Tree of Life at The British Museum's website" src="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/tol.gif" width="352" height="513" style="border:0;" /></a></p>

<p><em>Maputo, Mozambique, 2001</em></p>

<p>I love this thing, it's called <em>Throne of weapons</em> and it's made by "Transforming Arms into Tools", an artists collective from Mozambique. In particular, I love this quite voyeuristic drawing created by the Museum to support the presentation of the artwork. By labelling each item of millitary hardware, this presentation graphic adds an extra dimension to the original. Apologies for gilding this particular lily (as the original is very sensible black and white)...</p>

<p>From the Compass <span class="caps">TAE </span>page</p>

<blockquote><p>The throne is a product of the <span class="caps">TAE </span>project - <em>Transformaçaõ de Armas em Enxadas</em> (Transforming Arms into Tools) - whereby weapons previously used by combatants on both sides are voluntarily exchanged for agricultural, domestic and construction tools. The project was established in 1995 in Maputo by Bishop Dinis Sengulane of the Christian Council of Mozambique with the support of Christian Aid.</p></blockquote>
