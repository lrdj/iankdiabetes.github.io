<p>Jonathan and <a href="http://rosstaylor.squarespace.com/">Ross</a> over at <span class="caps">TMW </span>are working through the Thresher promo thing apparently organised by Mr Gapingvoid <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/">Hugh Macleod</a>. They both make some good points and <a title="Power of Viral (TMW Ideas)" href="http://tmwblogs.com/2006/12/power_of_viral.html#comment-21685">Ross points out</a> that the promo represents a 7% increase on discounting to coincide with Christmas and that after all the hooha, this may not harm Thresher's bottom line at all.</p>

<p>Well Ross, I have to ask, does this suggest (given Hugh's track record as a marketer) that this 'accidental' release might not be so accidental after all?</p>
