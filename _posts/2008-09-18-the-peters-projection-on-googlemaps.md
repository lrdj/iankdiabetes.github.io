I wonder is the photography manipulated in some sort of matrix to make its xy coords mathematically predictable? I have zero maths skills so will live in wonder and confusion but if it <strong>is</strong> projection based (mathematically projecting a sphere onto a flat surface), how cool would it be if Gmaps let you select your projection? My current fave is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall-Peters_projection">Peters projection</a> which shows accurate areas (and a high shock value) and goes some way to helping us find 'our place' on the planet (I would say <em>a few specks</em> is a truer assessment than <em>a Conquering Horde</em>)</p>
