<p>We'll, the big one <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/news/2005/08/movable_type_3_2.html">has just gone live</a> :-)</p>

<blockquote><p>Some of you asked for key points that are worth mentioning, so here's a<br />
list off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's a free update for any licensed user of MT 3.x</li>
<li>There's a $30 discount for personal users</li>
<li>All licenses support an unlimited number of blogs now</li>
<li>The system overview is new, letting you manage all your blogs in one<br />
place</li>
<li>We've got the best spam protection and community management around</li>
<li>And, as always, MT comes with great support and the backing of all you<br />
ProNet members</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>Well, I'm off to download, more later...</p>
