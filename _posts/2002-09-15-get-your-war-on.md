<p>I can't believe <a href="http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/war.html">this</a> was posted almost a year ago and I never came across it. There's fourteen pages of it too:-)</p>

<p><q> ...Oh my God, this War On Terrorism is gonna <em>rule!</em> I can't wait until the war is over and there's no more terrorism! </q></p>

<p><q> I know! Remember when the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>had a drug problem, and then we declared a War On Drugs, and now you can't buy drugs anymore? It'll be just like that... </q></p>

<p>And from the same author, check out <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/leperous/PhotoAlbum1.html">all the great posters</a>.</p>
