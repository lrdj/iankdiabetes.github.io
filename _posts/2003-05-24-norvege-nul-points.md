<p>Except this time round it was UK nul points. Has to be the first time--not a single point...</p>

<p>So Riga looks like a laugh, Turkey wins (strange song), the local presenters are exactly as suntanned, plastic and shiny as the last time I watched (1979 I'm guessing) oh, and Terry Wogan sounds pissed the whole time;-)</p>

<p>Strange entertainment...</p>
