<p>Prolific Web2 blogger Dion Hinchcliffe comments on the Tahoe campaign fallout (<a title="The Web-Powered Control Shift: Social Computing (web2.wsj2.com)" href="http://web2.wsj2.com/the_webpowered_control_shift_social_computing.htm">The Web-Powered Control Shift: Social Computing (web2.wsj2.com)</a>) and reading his blog--actually, I tend to spot his <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dionh/125444103/">awesome graphics</a> on Flickr first--I was reminded how hard it is for ad agencies (such as the one where I spend my days) to generate creative that invites co-creation and does generally give a stake in the outcome. </p>

<p>More often than not, the stake is more of a <s>stick</s> twig, maybe having your words appear on a website or entry into a prize draw. I mean sure, a lot of agencies are 'getting it' but can't we do something better? </p>

<p>After finally tracking the website down (it's all Flash of course, so that even if "moonbathing" had become a popular tag, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=moonbathing&amp;sourceid=mozilla2&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">googling it</a> got you nowhere) I spent ten minutes the other day inputting garbage into the Levi's moonbathing site (something about time travel, base-jumping off a Park Lane hotel roof and a bunch of other gibberish). It just doesn't deliver any sense of satisfaction, worth or fun. Mebbe I'm just getting old, but I've been describing the internet as a collaborative space for the last ten years and if this is as good as it gets I'm a wee bit depressed...</p>

<p>One thing I'm increasingly noticing is initiatives that are much more inclusive being driven by PR companies and I'm guessing this will increasingly become a challenge to us agency folk.</p>

<p>(btw, just dug out the Levis uri again. It's <a href="http://eu.levi.com/index.jsp?lang=en&amp;region=uk">http://eu.levi.com/index.jsp?lang=en&amp;region=uk</a> -- catchy, no?)</p>
