<p>While I'm at it, just noticed that Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. have changed the copyright notice on the Raging Cow blog. When they started, their identity was obscured behind a cryptic little &copy; symbol at the bottom left of the page. They have now changed that to a full <cite>&copy;2003 Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.</cite></p>

<p>Flog, flog, flog...</p>
