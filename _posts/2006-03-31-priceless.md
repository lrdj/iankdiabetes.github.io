<p>Been doing some research on the old co-creation thing for a presentation at work and came across Mastercard's <a title="priceless.com - Exclusives" href="http://priceless.com/promo/e1.html">priceless</a> site. The site gives you two videos to watch (they don't work on Mac/Firefox) and then asks you to participate by writing the script.</p>

<p>I can't help feeling it's not much fun.</p>

<p>Not only that, the entries become property of Mastercard (no, fuck-off) <em>and</em> I can even argue which film should be the winner--my stake in participating is down to some faceless pr company's deciding if they like my script:-(</p>

<p>Still, I'm sure many budding Bernbachs will take part and the offer of making your mark "officially" will compel enough entries.</p>

<p>Probably a lot more fun is to just do one yourself and whack it on Google video for all to enjoy. I found the following with a quick search for "Mastercard". I love the blow-job one:-)</p>
