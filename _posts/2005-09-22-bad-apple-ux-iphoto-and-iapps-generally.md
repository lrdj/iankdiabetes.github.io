<p>Well, don't get me started on the bloody 'brushed metal' look...  <span class="caps">OK, </span>on the whole I've been impressed with most of Apple's UX work. The iApps however are just plain shit and this little gem just about sums it up for<br />
me.</p>

<p>A screen is a fixed-width grid. A photograph is a fixed width grid. If you want to decide how large or small an image should be in a window it's really very simple. Depending on the resolution you're running,<br />
you want 1-up, 2-up, 3-up or more. What you <em>don't</em> want is the ability to resize in infinite increments. What this 'feature' actually achieves is that you can never get the image to the size you want -- the largest size which allows the display of x images in a given window.</p>

<p>In the pre-Nextstep, Apple design team, the slider you can see above would have been a drop-down, or a slider that snapped to the 1-up, 2-up etc sizes.</p>

<p>Grrrrr...</p>
