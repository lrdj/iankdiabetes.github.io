My 85mm prime lens finally arrived and I've been playing around with the various settings. The first thing that gets you is the sheer size of the front element. I may have said this before but it's the size of a small grapefruit.

The second thing is the clarity of the viewfinder. Looking through prism and lens you still get a very bright, large and clear composing experience. I'm still feeling a little guilty for buying the thing but damn it's good:-)

This shot is CLF this afternoon at a farm show. Lots of flowers and trees and some lovely light. The lens is wide open at F1.4 and I love what it does at the edges of the depth of field.
