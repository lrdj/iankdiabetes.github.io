<p>The Guardian had this to say</p>

<p><q> Parliament's history books record great rebellions of times gone by, but, in sheer weight of numbers at least, none match up to last night's defiance by 121 government backbenchers, all voting for an amendment describing the the case for war as 'yet unproven' </q></p>
