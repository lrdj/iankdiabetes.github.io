<p>I've got no idea if <a title="Ristretto Roasters" href="http://www.ristrettoroasters.com/">Ristretto Roasters</a> is any good or indeed if their coffee isn't burnt to shit like Starbucks' but featured prominently on their website is this "free wifi" graphic. So next time I'm in town I'll definitely drop in...</p>

<p>I still can't beleive that we have to pay for public wifi. I mean when you eat in a restaurant you don't pay for tap water or oxigen and even if in some extreme case you do, it's included in the exhorbitant markup you pay on your panini.</p>

<p>Next time someone approaches you with a business model involving walled gardens and in-store portal pages please do thwack 'em over the head with a base-station:-)</p>
