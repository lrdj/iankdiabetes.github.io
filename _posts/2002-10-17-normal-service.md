<p>Well, got home last night and had a very therapeutic cry. I've been letting things stack up recently and really need a break. Faiq, my evil scumbag neighbour manages to add his two cents of pain and frustration to the mix. We've just finished a very expensive bathroom rebuild and last night Nicki heard water trickling into the ceiling. The bastard refuses to properly mend the bath upstairs, so every six months or so water starts to leak into our flat&mdash;OK&mdash;I wasn't gonna get all riled up again, the purpose of this post was to say normal service has resumed:</p>

<p>Western political consultants should take a pointer from Sadam as <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,812879,00.html">The Guardian</a> informs me he was returned to office with 100% of the vote.</p>
