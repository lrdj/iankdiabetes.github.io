<p>Boy I've just worked myself into a lather over at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn">Barnett's blog</a>. Some chap in Canada has been going ballistic along the lines of his copyright is being infringed and his ad revenue swindled. </p>

<p>Alex asked the questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>When is it ok, is it ok to render content dynamically/statically created by another author on another site/service?</li>
<li>What is fair use, what is not?</li>
<li>Is it ok to take snippets of others' content and republish (as I have done above)..if so, how much is content is too much...10%, 50%, 80%, 100%?</li>
<li>If you do use a snippet, should you link to original source? (personally I think this should <span class="caps">ALWAYS </span>be the case)</li>
</ul>

<p>For me, Squeezer is a proxy, plain and simple. There just isn't just cause to go after them with a mallet (especially since their service's life will probably be quite short). I commented:</p>

<blockquote><p>I reckon once content is available online it should be treated as largely in the public domain.</p>

<p>It's no sin to chase audience and ad revenue by repurposing other people's content, but generally, readers want a relationship with a site, and these are best provided by active independent publishers who keep it fresh by keeping it coming.</p>

<p>I think Barnabas Kendall's "Why Skweezer is good for Content Publishers" is a bit ingenuous in places. In any case, he puts his finger on the real issue:</p>

<p>&gt; After all, certain sites (Bloglines for example)<br />
&gt; detect and offer alternative content to mobile<br />
&gt; browsers. In a perfect Internet, this would<br />
&gt; obviate Skweezer entirely.</p>

<p>As handsets improve (and they are--quickly) and websites become more semantic and more media neutral (and I think the rush is now officially on) services like Squeezer will become obsolete. I think we're looking at a couple of years, so not really anything to get your knickers in a twist about.</p>

<p>Besides, I've not yet found an aggregated or repurposed site that I favoured over its original. Or, in other words, while it's no sin, repurposing probably isn't the best way to build an audience.</p>

<p>Finally, I won't say Jim Elve is a psycho, but he's not so much way off the mark as missing the point entirely. For now, Skweezer is a proxy service. Period. Same as websitegarage and the modem proxy you get with your copy of Analog. As a hosted service that isn't a registered charity, of course they whack some ads at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>I think this exposes a sidecar issue: Google adsense will be rubbish until it adopts standards. Google, read my lips, The <span class="caps">IFRAME </span>tag is <span class="caps">NOT STANDARD </span>it is a deprecated <span class="caps">MSIE </span>extension <strong>grrr</strong></p>

<p>If Google let us store the adwords in page memory so they could easily be manipulated, Jim's ads would still be on his page.</p></blockquote>

<p>The lather I mentioned in the first paragraph is really down to Google's implementation. Adsense is everywhere. It's important, so why not implement it correctly?</p>
