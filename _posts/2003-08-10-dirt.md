<p>Most excellent shortcut to the pool through the guarded truffle-picking field. Unexpected 4WD fun actually, a very steep hill with tight s-bends on loose shingle and clumpy (is that a word) earth. I haven't had to use high ratio yet but the car actually stalled in first. Had to roll back down in reverse while switching to hi--fun. And at the end of it you come out of the woods at an old farmhouse with a gorgeous pool--am liking this :-)</p>

<p>Right, just off to Pisa to pick up the girls so I think I'll stop posting for a couple weeks.</p>
