<p><a href="/mm/nurburgring.mpg" title="Download the mpg file of an 8-minute lap of the Ring"><img src="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/nurburgring.gif" alt="An 8-minute lap of the Ring on an R100" height="199" width="200" class="left" style="float:left;border:none;" /></a> Which, as far as my crude appreciation of the language of Siegfried goes, translates to <em>the wall isn't so motorcycle-friendly</em> (he's commenting on an orange crash barrier he avoids at a corner's apex). </p>

<p>I downloaded this thing late last night and had a watch this morning--and I've forgotten the site I found it at--will credit later if i can track it down. </p>

<p>The most noticeable feature is the smoothness of the ride, no harsh moves and very little slowing down. It feels like a Gran Turismo education tape, particularly the one were you have to complete a time trial in a Eunos Roadster. The car is very underpowered, and it's impossible to complete the Mountain track on time without the most delicate touch. </p>

<p>This particular lap is done on what looks like an <span class="caps">R100 BMW, </span>so not exactly a horsepower fiend, but the left-hand needle rarely drops beneath the 240kph mark</p>

<p>Drool...</p>
