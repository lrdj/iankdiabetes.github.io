<p>I saw this video and really enjoyed its simple method of creating the real user feedback we (as <span class="caps">DSG</span>i) so rarely do.</p>

<p><object style="height: 344px; width: 425px"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/QckIzHC99Xc"><param  name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/QckIzHC99Xc" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="425" height="344"></object></p>

<p>I think it would be great to start by testing a number of users (maybe just some non eCommerce types from head office) now and track how our improvements in design, content, functionality and proposition are received by some users when given a number of specific tasks to do.</p>

<p>I would be happy to work with someone in Dug's team to get this off the ground... answers on a post card to <a href="mailto:rob.southern@dsgiplc.com">rob.southern@dsgiplc.com</a>!!</p>
