<p>Have just struggled through another hummaniteinenglish.com <a href="http://www.humaniteinenglish.com/news/output/editorial_1086974435.shtml">translation</a>. A very interesting piece about the effect on left-wing parties of forgetting one's left wing. I worry a bit, the French is pretty pompous and poorly written (imho) and the guy in charge hasn't got the resources to do a lot of editing...</p>

<p>If there are any lefties out there with good English writing skills, <a href="mailto:fuyet@humaniteinenglish.com?subject=I%20would%20like%20to%20volunteer%20to%20review%20your%20translations%20for%20humainenglish.com">the editor</a> might welcome a volunteer editor/reviewer to hammer the texts back into English:-)</p>
