Have meant to get a look at these for aaaages now... You pass them on the motorway between Stirling and Edinburgh but you're always going somewhere, so no time to stop and have a look around (hey speaking of taking a look around, did you know today is the 30th aniversary of Ferris Bueller's Day Off?)...

Friends up from London giving us an excuse to do some sight-seeing
