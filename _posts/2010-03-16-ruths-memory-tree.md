<p>Her tree is impermanent, an apple tree among the firs, but the thoughts expressed should last forever... </p>

<p>This is the last post about Ruth's passing and subsequent service. I am now going to return this blog to its normal pattern of nonsense from Dug's head. I am building a page for Mom and will transfer all the Jobbles Wood content to there when it's ready.</p>

<p>If you want to add a thought to the tree picture, you can comment here or add your thoughts to the picture's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bozo/4432799193/">Flickr page</a></p>
