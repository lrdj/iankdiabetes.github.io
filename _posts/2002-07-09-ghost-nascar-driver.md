<p>I remember preparing for Halloween when I was in 3rd grade at the American school in Milan. One of the kids had a real Bell helmet and a driving suit painted black with a white skeleton all over it. I couldn't believe how cool that was (even though I'd never heard of <span class="caps">NASCAR</span>). Stock car racing does <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/dan30thtransam/LOULAZZARO/">hold a particular spot</a> in the American subconscious methinks...</p>
