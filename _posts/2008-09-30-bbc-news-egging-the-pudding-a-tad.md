<p>OK so the news late last night was pretty horrific. Yes, we're all setting up barter economies and I've started planting vegetables, but the thing that really did it was the <span class="caps">BBC </span>art department. </p>

<p>First, we had the great big red "CRISIS" artwork background, red on white with an extrabold down-arrow extending the "R" downwards to the studio floor. Last night it was the share price indicator (again, in glowing, black-on-red) which was synchronised to the newsreader "then <em>this</em> happened" and the red line takes a vertical plunge. </p>

<p>Basically, only Chris Morris did it better:</p>

<p>If they keep this up they'll have us wearing denim overalls and playing ukulele on the G-Man breadline by next Monday.</p>
