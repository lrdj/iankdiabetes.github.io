<p>dear all, it has been mighty quiet of late on Donkey. If I carry on like this I'll end up on deadsites.com, a combination of total IT meltdown (no workstation, no powerbook), freakout over building works (my dodgy builder claims he is taking me to court, which should be interesting), and trying to take care of my wee family has meant that the few minutes I can grab at somebody else's keyboard have had to be spent on work work work (and now, a full-stop&mdash;halleluya!).</p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to let people know that my life hasn't stopped, and there is still a never-ending queue of bugbears for me to complain about, the most recent being London cyclists, Westminster Council's attitute to motorcycle parking, the shitty quality of Dell keyboards (as I feel my wrist siezing up) and the way legal departments manage to make simple things take forever...</p>
