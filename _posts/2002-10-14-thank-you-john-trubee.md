<p>Not sure what reminded me of <a href="http://www.aspma.com/trubee.htm">this song</a>. <i>(Lyrics reproduced without permission)</i></p>

<p><q> Peace &amp; Love<br /> <br /> I got high last night on <span class="caps">LSD</span><br /> My mind was beautiful, and I was free<br /> Warts loved my nipples because they are pink<br /> Vomit on me, baby<br /> Yeah Yeah Yeah.<br /> <br /> Stevie Wonder's penis is erect because he's blind<br /> It's erect because he's blind, it's erect because he's blind<br /> Stevie Wonder's penis is erect because he's blind<br /> It's erect because he is blind<br /> <br /> Let's make love under the stars and watch for <span class="caps">UFO</span>s<br /> And if little baby Martians come out of the <span class="caps">UFO</span>s<br /> You can fuck them<br /> Yeah Yeah Yeah.<br /> <br /> The zebra spilled its plastinia on bemis<br /> And the gelatin fingers oozed electric marbles<br /> Ramona's titties died in hell<br /> And the Nazis want to kill everyone.<br /> <br /> Stevie Wonder's penis is erect because he's blind ... etc. </q></p>
