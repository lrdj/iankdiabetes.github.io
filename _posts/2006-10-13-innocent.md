<p>I love this <a title="innocent drinks : all about us" href="http://www.innocentdrinks.co.uk/us/our_story/">little story</a> from the innocent website. In fact i love most of the copywriting on the site. I would have thought they'd passed the tipping point of evil by now but you couldn't tell by looking at their website:-)</p>

<blockquote><p>In fact, being accountable to our customers is something that is in our blood. In the summer of 1998 when we had developed our first smoothie recipes but were still nervous about giving up our proper jobs, we bought Â£500 worth of fruit, turned it into smoothies and sold them from a stall at a little music festival in London. We put up a big sign saying 'Do you think we should give up our jobs to make these smoothies?' and put out a bin saying 'YES' and a bin saying 'NO' and asked people to put the empty bottle in the right bin. At the end of the weekend the 'YES' bin was full so we went in the next day and resigned.</p></blockquote>
