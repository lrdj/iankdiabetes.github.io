<p>Well, this morning I've noticed a couple:</p>

<ul>
<li>the great (if slightly over the top) music that accompanies tv series, movies and historical reenactments. There's something about mentions of Molière and Richelieu that brings me back a medley of pleasant, childhood memories</li>
<li>the formal acknowledgment given in lifts, restaurants and a bunch of other public places. I'm increasingly dissatisfied with the "let's just ignore each other until one of us gets off the lift" thing we do...</li>
</ul>
