<p>I figured if I let <span class="caps">CLF </span>paint my face as I painted hers, I would be able to make a reasonable likeness of a ginger cat&#8217;s face on hers. </p>

<p>In the end, my face was covered with red stripes and <span class="caps">CLF </span>had what could be mistaken for a rash on her forehead&#8212;not a very succesful attempt, but I imagine this face-painting lark has some miles in it yet, she&#8217;s only two-and-a-half after all&#8230;</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s comming up to three o&#8217;clock and I&#8217;m off to her nursery&#8217;s Halloween party:-)</p>
