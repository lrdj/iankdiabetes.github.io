<p>When a registrar gives away your name to a fraudulent applicant and then refuses to do anything about it, it's time to change registrars. I believe I put it like this in an earlier post...</p>

<p><q>Talk about a fucking meltdown &mdash; this is like santa coming 'round on boxing day to take your presents away</q></p>

<p><a href="http://www.internic.net/">Internic</a> maintains <a href="http://www.internic.net/origin.html">a list</a> of accredited registrars. Go there now. Find a new friend and transfer all your domains.</p>
