<p>And while I'm posting, I just wanted to add that after almost two years of me speaking not a word of English to her, little <span class="caps">CLF </span>has finally starting saying a few words of French...</p>

<p>"chapeau", "couteau", "murs", "p&acirc;tes", "yaourt"</p>

<p>Ok, so not the most useful vocab to have for when she parachutes behind enemy lines to hook up with the French resistance, but it's a start :-)</p>

<p>Oh, and yes I've taken loads of great pictures of her over the last nine months but no, you can't see them because my scrapbook application is crap (so sue me I'm not a programmer). Still hoping to get Moveable Type up soon, at which point lots more pics.</p>

<p>Cause I know that really, the only reason anyone reads this thing is to see picture of <span class="caps">CLF </span>;-)</p>
