<p>Auntie Ohna went to a different primary school (not sure why). I was at the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps?q=EaB+Lamartine&amp;ll=48.865696%2C2.280596&amp;spn=0.005928%2C0.007296&amp;sll=48.866105%2C2.279697&amp;layer=c&amp;cid=9968178925293629520&amp;cbp=13%2C300.75%2C%2C0%2C0.71&amp;panoid=-X08csjl-9bH0v7ZptyF-w&amp;hq=EaB+Lamartine&amp;t=m&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A&amp;cbll=48.866046%2C2.279754">Ecole Active Bilingue</a> on Rue de la Pompe from age 7 (must ask Ohna why she was elsewhere) and took the Metro back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Muette_(Paris_MÃ©tro)">La Muette</a> on my own (not far but I'm struggling letting you guys out of the house even at your age!</p>

<p>Anyways, this video reminded me of all the time I used to spend in the street. I had a bicycle and used it, if we weren't colonising vacant lots near the Parc des Princes we were hanging around on the corner with the neighbour's kids.</p>

<p>Great video and amasing what we've done to ourselves in the name of comfort and convenience... </p>
