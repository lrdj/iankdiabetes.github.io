So I bought Nicki a Sony Ericsson <span class="caps">K750</span>i as she's starting to write about food again and she needed a decent camera to upload to Flickr with. I just can't get over the image quality on the thing. I pumps out 1600&#215;1200 jpegs with only the faintest artefacts visible in blurry areas (it looks like a ccd pixel-grid, it sort of leaves background noise in the shape of vertical lines)</p>
