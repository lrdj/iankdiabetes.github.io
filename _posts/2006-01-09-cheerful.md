<p>So this is the time of year when we say good-bye to our Christmas trees. I have to say, there is something just a bit depressing about all these abandoned trees. I mean, I know they're not puppies or anything but how can you be indifferent--one minute we're inviting them into our sitting room and covering them with glitter, the next we're lobbing them out the window:-(</p>
