<p>People have been asking about Nicki's car. The news so far is that Clive Sutton, the UK dealership has replaced it with apologies and we are waiting for the official response from Daimler-Chrysler. If I had polls enabled on Donkey, I'd ask what sort of position I should take. I mean, they could have killed my whole family. </p>

<p>What if the thing had flared up in traffic? </p>

<p>The imobiliser would have come on, the electric doors and windows would have been locked and Nick and <span class="caps">CLF </span>would have both been dead in seconds. I'm trying to avoid thinking along those lines as it is freaking me out a bit, but I'd still like to hear from anyone out there who has had a similar experience. Anyone?</p>
