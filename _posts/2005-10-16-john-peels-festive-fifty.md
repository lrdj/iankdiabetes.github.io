<p>A <a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/2005/10/festive_fifty.html">friend of Billy's</a> wanted this word spread:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear All</p>

<p>I would be grateful if you would do two things for me to mark one John Peel’s passing:</p>

<p>As in the spirit of the original Festive Fifty, please send me your top three tracks (singles or LP tracks) in order 1 2 3. Please ensure you send both name of track as well as artist/group</p>

<p>Send this email to a bunch of people, asking them to send their top 3 to me at <a href="mailto:geoff.curran@btinternet.com">geoff.curran@btinternet.com</a> by midnight 17th December</p>

<p>I will collate the answers and put out a definitive Festive Fifty at www.festivefifty.net on 24th December this year</p>

<p>I know this sounds a little…….but my love of music was fuelled by Peelie and having read the Mick Wall book, it brought it home how much he gave us and I would like to give a little back myself. If you think this is bollocks, then please do not reply but do me a favour, send it on as there are plenty of people who will not feel that way.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Geoff</p></blockquote>

<p>Will have to have a think... The hardest part with these things is remembering an awesome track that wasn't released in December 2004 if you know what I mean.</p>
