<p>Just wanted to register my surprise at the poor quality of <span class="caps">BTO</span>penzone's wi-fi offering. Apart from the just plain cryptic interface of the wi-fi start page (the page your brower is redirected to when you attempt to browse from a hot-spot) there is the unreliability of the thing.</p>

<p>I foolishly bought a 24-hour coupon figuring I'd use it up in my travels. So far i've tried to use it in two hotels and one train station. In every case I struggled to get connected and when I did finally get online the damn router rebooted every five minutes leaving me to struggle to fill in web forms before the next cycle. </p>

<p>Not smart.</p>

<p>So, I'm writing this from the Costas in Waterloo station. My wi-fi menu show <span class="caps">BTO</span>penzone (tried, couldn't connect), Eurospot and Readytosurf. In the end I've bought time with readytosurf. </p>

<p>They've got a sensible bit of cross-platform javascript to manage the connection timer and all the back-end redirect stuff is completely seamless. And so far, the router hasn't cycled. </p>

<p>Lucky thing Costas has wooden tables...</p>
