<p>An upbeat view on the year ahead from <a href="http://www.collaboratemarketing.com/modernmarketing/2010/01/from-like-this-to-buy-that.html">James</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The world has changed.  Facebook delivers shopping tips from our friends, the pocket browser is becoming the norm, your phone is developing a sense of direction and we all want one-click commerce.  In short, the conditions for economic innovation look ripe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Love the idea that the new big ideas for business will likely <em>appear quite strange</em> (hey, if we're nearing the end of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondratiev_wave">Krondatieff winter</a> the cycle of regrowth is most likely going to start with the unusual--the usual having run its course) and most certainly agree they might include "buy" buttons on smartphones:-)</p>
