<p>So Iain Tait's getting <a title="Computers Behind Blogs at iain tait | crackunit.com" href="http://www.crackunit.com/computersbehindblogs/">all memetastic</a> on our ass :-)</p>

<p>Well, to answer your question Iain, I seem to be posting from mostly a kind of Diane Arbusy/David Lynchy sort of shitty hotel room situation. Does that influence my blogging? Good question, I guess it might, but mostly because of time restrictions. Information architecture is a job performed 50% of the time in a jacket and cufflinks and the other 50% in one's pants.</p>

<p>In my case, the blogging is mostly in the pants category;-)</p>
