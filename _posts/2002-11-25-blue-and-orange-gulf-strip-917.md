<p>Yes, I was a teenager in the 70s, and yes, I was a motor racing fan growing up in France, so the Le Mans 24H race was a fairly big deal. Anyway, this might explain my feeling of joy as I came across <a href="http://www.porsche917.com.ar/videos02.htm">this fan site</a> of the porsche 917 including videos of the real machine in action (was doing some research re Aston Martin for work, lots of listening to engines-vroom).</p>
