<p>This is Fred's letter to Polly, his mum. It was written on the eve of the May 8, 1915 offensive and signed with the words <em>I'm going to do my duty gladly</em>. Fred survived both the offensive and the war and the regimental padre kept the letters, unopened.</p>

<p>In the note, Fred mentions a papal blessing. He may be referring to Pope Benedict <span class="caps">XV'</span>s <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xv/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xv_exh_19150728_fummo-chiamati_it.html">Allorch√© fummo chiamati</a> which was issued on 28 July 1915.</p>
