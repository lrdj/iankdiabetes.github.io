<p>I'm on a couple of usability lists and one of them sparked a slightly strange exchange of messages a few minutes ago:</p>

<blockquote><p>&gt; 8:00:01 (in fact 8:00:00 + 1/infinity seconds)</p>

<p>That would be 8:00:00 + (the smallest increment that the clock measures).</p>

<p>You can't divide an integer by infinity.  (Nor a rational number, nor an irrational number, nor a complex number, etc. -- for those who would quibble that I have limited it to integers :-)</p></blockquote>

<p>So what did we talk about before we had the internet?</p>
