<p>So my accountant tells me I need to make sure and complete my <span class="caps">VAT </span>registration. Don't worry he says, you're an internet consultant so you'll have no trouble...</p>

<p>So here I go, whoops, something's awry with the vat section of the website, it appears to have lost its stylesheet (no doubt an indirect result of using the .Net framework).</p>

<p>So I call the helpline and am assured that even though the whole site (apart from the <span class="caps">VAT </span>bit) is working and it's just that I need to use internet explorer. But, I say, I haven't got <span class="caps">IE, </span>how can I pay my tax? At which point I was told to go away and stop being an annoying taxpayer...</p>

<p>I think it may be time to revert to paper processes on this one!</p>
