<p>Wow, a press ad and a web site and it took a good 30 minutes to figure out what it was about.</p>

<p>Turns out Atom40 make these <a href="https://www.atom40.com/buy/step1.asp?p_currency=EURO&amp;next=t">really cool tables</a> cut from blocks of sandstone. Now, all I need to know is what this has to do with an anorexic model in her pants.</p>
