<p>Recently lost my rag with a very nice person on one of the <span class="caps">HCI </span>lists I subscribe to. My juvenile, agressive and totally uncalled-for behaviour was triggered by the fact that the person works at Verisign (regular readers may remember <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/dugs_random_musings/say_goodbye_to_netsol_verisign.html">this</a>, <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/dugs_random_musings/649411011.html">this</a>, <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/dugs_random_musings/the_scum_that_just_wont_die.html">this</a>, <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/dugs_random_musings/more_verisign.html">this</a>, or even <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/le_enraged_mutton/lets_put_netsol_to_death.html">this</a> or may even have displayed <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/le_enraged_mutton/leaving_verisign.html">this banner</a>). She was enquiring about font-sizes, not as it turns out whether scalable fonts in web services are a good idea (she already knows they are) but whether they were in use in real-world applications (as opposed to public-facing websites). </p>

<p>As part of the general flow of font-size-related helpfulness, one of the respondents posted an interesting page from <a href="http://www.humanfactors.com/downloads/feb02.asp">Human Factors</a></p>

<blockquote><p>...What can we conclude from these studies?</p>

<ul>
<li>No Web page fonts should be less than 10-points,</li>
<li>Optimal reading speed for most adults will be elicited with 12-point fonts (size=3)</li>
<li>There is probably no reliable difference in reading speed for most adults when viewing common font styles (Arial, Verdana, Georgia, Times New Roman),</li>
<li>Most users tend to prefer sans serif fonts (Arial, Verdana), and</li>
<li>Older users will benefit from type sizes that are at least 14-points.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>All the tests mentioned in the article were performed with black text on a white background, but the three different tests used different monitor sizes and resolutions which makes useful comparison difficult.</p>

<p>The findings were helpful, but only up to a point. Strangely, all the research is conducted in point units rather than pixels (font-size:9px) or keywords (font-size:x-small) which would have been more useful, as point measures have no real consistency in the world web browsers, OSs, video cards and monitors.</p>

<p>Other factors would have increased the usefulness of this research. </p>

<p>The relationship between point-size and line-length is not factored in and would definitely account for some of the results. Not including a number of characters per line in a readability test isn't such a great idea (strangely, the guy who taught me this stuff specified number of words, not characters--I've never worked out if the brain handles words and characters differently and whether I should be counting characters or words in my layouts). </p>

<p>Anyways, getting back on topic, I was able to report that a large financial services institution that I was contracting for a couple of weeks back has implemented scalable fonts <strong>even</strong> in it's 'private' applications (it offers password-protected tools for UK financial advisers) which is really very encouraging.</p>

<p>Finally, has anyone used the <a href="http://www.humanfactors.com/about/swmethod.asp">Schaffer-Weinschenk Method</a> of user-centred design and is it any good?</p>
