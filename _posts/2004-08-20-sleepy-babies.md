<p>As long as I'm messing about with the video capture on the ixus, one of the nicest things (well, one of many many nice things, but one that stands out in a particular way) about having a young child is the way they fall asleep on you. </p>

<p>More specifically, after all the time you spend reading stories, making hot milk, cajolling, singing, bouncing and otherwise exercising your most potent diplomatic muscle in an incessant battle to get the reluctant toddler to bed, one of the nicest things is the way your baby's hair smells when you wake her from her lunchtime nap and she nuzzles into your shoulder:-)</p>
