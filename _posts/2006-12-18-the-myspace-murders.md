<p>Welcome to a world of prurience we didn't even know existed. No longer will the currious need to dig through the sleazier end of the tabloid press to get their thrills. We can all now view our serial killers' MySpace page and shudder...</p>

<p>Well, twelve hours after the arrest and it looks like MySpace has taken down Tom Stephens' <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=85784962">profile page</a>. Google's cache has flushed the page as well. Chalk this up as another internet milestone, the first serial killer with a website. Of course if the man's innocent we're going to feel a little stupid and I sure hope Myspace has kept a backup...</p>
