<p>Ok, I'd like someone to explain what the robot or crawler or whatever it is that keeps searching for <em>"quaint or donkey or prosodic or compels or counterbalance"</em> is doing? Is it a component of some large web-cataloging device, is it using the results to generate some incredibly clever semantic maps of our virtual world, &iquest;che pasa? here...</p>

<p>Or is it just some smartass giving me a hard time;-)</p>
