<p>I just love it that Caterina hasn't changed her blog template since the dawn of time:-) And now the imperatrix is up to <a href="http://www.hunch.com/">something new</a> and of course exciting... </p>

<blockquote><p><strong>What is Hunch?</strong><br />
Look. Decision-making is difficult, and decisions have to be made constantly. What should I be for Halloween? Do I need a Porsche? Does my hipster facial hair make me look stupid? Is Phoenix a good place to retire? Whom should I vote for? What toe ring should I buy?</p>

<p>It's dark and lonely work. Coin-flipping, I Ching consultation, closing your eyes and jumping, postponing the inevitable, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and asking your sister are all time-honored means of coming to a decision -- and yet we think there's room for one more: Hunch.</p>

<p>Hunch is a decision-making site, customized for you. Which means Hunch gets to know you, then asks you 10 questions about a topic (usually fewer!), and provides a result -- a Hunch, if you will. It gives you results it wouldn't give other people. </p></blockquote>
