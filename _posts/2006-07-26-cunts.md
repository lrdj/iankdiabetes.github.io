<p>I haven't got the plugin installed that lets you ping a post back to the index without disrupting the order of the posts so I can't highlight the post, but I wanted to show you the most recent comment from <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/family/is_bt_still_shit.html">an old post I did about BT</a> which reffered to <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/le_enraged_mutton/is_bt_shit_as_well.html">an even older post</a> that also had some good comments on it...</p>

<blockquote><p>I work for BT and even i am disgusted by them. They have the monopoly and basically don't give a f*ck about their customers. I get customers screaming at me and crying down the phone with problem after problem day after day, but BT don't give us, the call agents, the resources or authorisation to help them. They don't care if we help them, they just want to grab their money. So frustrating!! Basically BT are money grabbing bloodsuckers and i wouldn't touch them with a 10 ft barge pole!! Oh... and while the bosses are rolling in it from all the money they drain from people for their shit service, we're on little more than minimum wage! Cunts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now that's what i call having an opinion. Has anyone called the secret phone number recently? I can't imagine it still works...</p>
