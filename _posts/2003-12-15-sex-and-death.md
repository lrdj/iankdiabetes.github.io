<p>Nick and I took <span class="caps">CLF </span>to see the Turner Prize show at the Tate yesterday. Much fun was had all around, in particular by winding up guards by pulling on exhibit ropes and by attempting to eat the Chapmans' worms (which were v. securely fastened, thankfully).</p>

<p>Discovered that the central banister up to the first floor makes v. exciting slide :-)</p>
