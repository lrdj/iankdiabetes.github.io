<p>I was beginning to think the good works of the <a href="http://www.asquithparents.com/westhampstead/2005/05/asquith_court_w.html#comments">Asquith Eight</a> were going to go unnoticed forever.</p>

<p>But no! We've finally been indexed by Google...</p>

<p>If you or someone you know has a toddler in the care of an Asquith Court nursery you should absolutely be reading about the West Hampstead horror stories. The fight is currently still going on, but I'm guessing that Mum's united shall never be undone;-)</p>

<p>And just to make this absolutely clear in a linky kind of way, <a href="http://www.asquithparents.com/westhampstead/">this link</a> is the start page of the <a href="http://www.asquithparents.com/westhampstead/">Asquith Court Parents Association</a> website.</p>
