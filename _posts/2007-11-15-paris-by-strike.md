<li>07:30 good catch-up meeting with Agathe near République</li>
<li>11:30 continue reviewing backup screens with Thomas P near bastill3</li>
<li>a large chunk of the afternoon: walking from Bastille to Gare du Nord because the <span class="caps">RATP </span>strikers lied to me about there being a few <em>rames</em> left in service to take me home. Long walk carrying luggage punctuated with taunting temptings at each Vélib station (haleluya, there's a Vélib... argggg it has no chain/seat/tires...)</li>
</ol>
