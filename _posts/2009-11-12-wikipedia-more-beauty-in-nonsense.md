<p>Heather pointed us at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_(band)">Magma's page</a> on Wikipedia. I loved this disambiguation notice just as a fragment of culture in itself:</p>

<blockquote><p>Note that there have been at least five other, lesser-known bands named Magma: a drum and organ rock duo from Germany in the 1970s, a short-lived Polish pop band in the late 1990s who recorded only two albums and some singles (including "Aisha" cover), a South Korean band who played powerful college hard rock in 1980s, a Romanian thrash metal band in the 2000's and an Argentine progressive folk band from the 1980s.</p></blockquote>
