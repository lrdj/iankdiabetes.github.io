<p>So does anyone else find it absurd that the framers of the <span class="caps">DVD </span>standards decided it would be 'versatile' to have every crummy little post-production house design human-computer interfaces? I mean, I was amazed when when my new telly just set itself up automatically with a clear and helpful on-screen menu. Let's see... oh it's just taken about fifteen years for the <span class="caps">VHS </span>makers to get the interface to video recording right. You'd think someone at Sony might have twigged and suggested that there might be interface guidelines to help the lowly film company get it right, or even better, why not just have a standard interface?</p>

<p>I'll tell you, it doesn't feel very 'versatile' when every time i put a <span class="caps">DVD </span>in the machine I have to work out some bloody cryptic interface (and you thought the web was bad) just to play a damn film.</p>
