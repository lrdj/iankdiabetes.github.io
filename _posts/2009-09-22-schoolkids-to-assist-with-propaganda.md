<p>Another chilling article on the <span class="caps">RIAA </span>over on the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/09/riaa-asks-schoolkids-assist-propaganda"><span class="caps">EFF </span>website</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>after spending countless dollars on failed advertising campaigns against peer-to-peer file-sharing, the <span class="caps">RIAA </span>has created a classroom activity to outsource the campaign to schoolchildren. Next up: A classroom activity where kids police peer-to-peer networks in search of potential infringers!</p></blockquote>

<p>The sooner musicians can work with companies that aren't part of the <span class="caps">RIAA </span>the better. Maybe labels should produce an "artists advisory" sticker: "attention: this company supports civil misinformation and the removal of citizen's fair-use rights by any means. Get someone else to distribute your music".</p>
