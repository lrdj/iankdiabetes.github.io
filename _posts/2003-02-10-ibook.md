<p>I forget if I mentioned this already, but those of you using an iBook by accident (as in you really need to be on a Powerbook but tricks of fate etc etc) might want to modify the Open firmware to kill mirroring. Instructions to re-enable the "arrange" tab in the monitors control panel are <a href="http://www.rutemoeller.com/mp/ibook/ibook_e.html">here</a></p>

<p>If you have no idea what I'm on about then no need to worry really;-)</p>

<p>Btw, I tried this on a recent (32meg vram/800) iBook, but it appears to work well on several generations.</p>
