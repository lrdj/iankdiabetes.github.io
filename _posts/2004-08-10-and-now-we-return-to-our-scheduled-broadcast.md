<p>I had so many bits, bobs and backups tied into my blogging engine that it was taking me forever to migrate safely to Movable Type. A negative side-effect of running what was a truly nasty hack in the first place was that the whole site got bogged down. </p>

<p>The family has been begging for pictures of <span class="caps">CLF, </span>but I couldn't deliver as the process of updating the scrapbook had become so tortuous as to make it impossible.</p>

<p>Simply posting meant sending several emails, struggling with my rubbish editing interface and waiting hours for the poor old <span class="caps">MGI </span>app server to crunch through miles of slow-moving database records.</p>

<p>So in the end, I decided to just kill the thing. I exported the database, hacked it up as best I could in bbedit (if anyone needs the grep pattern to change date formats from euro to us in an MT db export, drop me a line) and bumped the dns. So to cut a long story short, the data's all here, but there will be many, many things that don't work properly. I'm as stuck-in as possible and will try to do fixes daily until everything is working ok. As usual, feel at liberty to hurl abuse my way via email (as I don't think the commenting is working correctly yet)</p>
