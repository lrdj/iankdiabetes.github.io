<p>One of the guys in strategy just sent this around. Apparently the <a href="http://www.masturbate-a-thon.co.uk/">Masturbathon</a> is to support the <a href="http://www.mariestopes.org.uk/">Marie Stopes</a> reproductive health charity.</p>

<p>They're absolutely serious and go into some detail about the logistics:</p>

<blockquote><p>Once you have checked in your belongings please find your place in the relevant area for you. There are four main areas: The Comfort area, Women only area, Men only area and a mixed area. The areas are separated and you will not be able to view single-gender areas from the mixed area. We recommend that you spend some time in the Comfort area, which is a no masturbation zone, to acclimatise and get comfortable before proceeding to one of the other rooms.</p>

<p>The style inside is a comfortable Moroccan theme with plenty of pillows and recliner cushions. There will be relaxing music and plenty of visual stimulation to help you get in the mood. The environment is clean and padded with places to lie back all around the room. There are individual cubicles for those who prefer privacy. Fresh disposable paper sheets will be available for every participant. So will extra batteries and plenty of ID Lubricants.</p></blockquote>
