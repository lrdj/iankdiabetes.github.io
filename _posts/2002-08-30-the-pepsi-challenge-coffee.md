<p>Just had a latte at Costa's on West End Lane. I can't believe I used to drink Starbucks coffee. I'd tried it the world over and no matter how many italian-ish words I used, no matter how I attempted to explain how the foam or lack of foam was supposed to be, the number of shots (catches breath) no matter how much milk, sugar, hot water, juju beads&mdash;whatever&mdash;I added or subtracted from that liquid they call coffee it was always shit.</p>

<p>More fool me for trying over and over again?what was that Chinese proverb about a man falling over a log?</p>

<p>Those bloggers out there who list west hampstead as your tube station <a href="http://londonbloggers.iamcal.com/station.php?id=175">you know who you are</a> try this simple test. Get a single expresso from Starbucks and a single expresso from Costa, sit down in Costa (the more comfortable shop) and try them side by side. It should be blindingly obvious which one is burnt and which one isn't...</p>
