<p>I was caught with my pants down by <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/2004/11/critical_bug_dont_delete_weblogs">this bug</a> in late September. After deleting both Donkey and <a href="http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/">Roblog</a> databases I've finally found the time over Christmas to rebuild all the templates from scratch. So keep your MT database backed up campers.</p>

<p>On the bright side, I was pretty sure I was a major moron for deleting a blog--not only once, but twice.</p>

<p>I <strong>am</strong> actually a moron for forgetting that my whole /www directory is backed up daily by my host. By the time I had remembered and requested a restore, the backup  had incorporated the delete. Stupid stupid stupid ;-)</p>
