<p>It amazes me that the phrase "Wireless applications are not dead" only returns one result (a rambling piece I wrote on wml pop clients and so on). Of course without the quotes you get a lot more...</p>

<p>And on the subject of Google, did you know it's got a hidden phone directory built in (it even does reverse lookups)? I've lost the <span class="caps">URL </span>so if any kind soul knows about this, I'd welcome a reminder.</p>
