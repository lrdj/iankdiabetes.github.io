<p>Talk about what makes a great customer experience... My O2 iPhone has been down for four days now and no amount of calls to the 'support' line and emails to the help-desk seem to make any difference. If I can find the energy I'll log each step in the exchange as right from buying the phone it's been one UX downer after another...</p>

<p>As a last ditch effort, I've just sent the following to support (mark of a quality customer experience: somebody steps up to the plate and takes responsibility. So far O2 0/10 on that front):</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear O2 'support'</p>

<p>This is the fourth day I have not had an active working number on my iPhone.</p>

<p>I purchased this iPhone from you 2 years ago. This iPhone is:</p>

<p><span class="caps">IMEI </span>= 01 161400 578383 7<br />
With <span class="caps">ICCID </span>= 8944 1100 6422 5894 959<br />
Number = +44 7515 661 655</p>

<p>This phone has not been working since the 29th of March 2010.</p>

<p>I note that because you are not supplying the services I pay you for, your service may be deemed "substantially not as described" under British law and therefore, this voids the contract between us.</p>

<p>If my phone is not working by <span class="caps">GMT18</span>:00 today I shall consider our contracts (I have 2 contracts with O2) void and cease payments to you.</p>

<p>All the best,<br />
Dug</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, and by the way, Ofcom are <a href="http://twitter.com/ofcom">on Twitter</a> I wonder if that account is really run by an Ofcom representative?</p>
