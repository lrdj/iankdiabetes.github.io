<p>Just tried to join the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/humaniteinenglish/">Yahoo Group</a> of <a href="http://www.humaniteinenglish.com/">a project</a> I'm working on.</p>

<p>You know how there are a jillion Yahoo users, well, try finding a username that isn't taken. Seriously, this is getting ridiculous, why can't Yahoo switch to an email-based handle, or allow handle duplicates as long as some combination of other data is unique?</p>

<p>"yahoogroups@safs.demon.co.uk" was taken (they suggested "yahoogroups@safs.demon.co.uk2000") -- "bozo" was taken (of course), but "bozobozobozo" was taken as well! And, I have to say, the suggested alternative "bozobozobozo2000" really pushes the envelope&hellip; You'd think that a company as big as Yahoo could use some sort of clever language-based suggestions?</p>

<p>In the end, the wordy-but-mnemonic "dugathumaniteinenglish" was also unavailable, so either Yahoo Groups is broken or Satan is in charge of the user registration.</p>
