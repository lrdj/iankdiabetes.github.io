<p>It's funny, I was thinking: <cite>God I'm glad no one wants me to do javascript rollovers anymore</cite>. For some reason, I've just stopped using them&mdash;they're a nasty, cheesy hack and I'm desperately trying to stay away from cheesy hacks in my design work. Basically, if there is a "hover" event handler (onmouseover) in a piece of browser software, why not use <span class="caps">CSS </span>to do your effect? It's lighter, cleaner nicer, goes to church and brushes its teeth...</p>

<p>And thank you <a href="http://www.kottke.org/02/08/020820rollover_goo.html">Jason</a> for reminding me of this:-)</p>
