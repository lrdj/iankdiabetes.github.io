<p>Well, letting the side down again I'm afraid&mdash;things are getting a bit frantic at work (which is good). Just crankin away at my "to do" list... Ok, I'd better provide a link: just had a slightly surreal conversation with <a href="http://www.momorgan.com/">mo</a> via icq:</p>

<p><q> mo: you're not the bloke down the road from me who plays hip-hop very loudly at 3am are you? ;) </q></p>

<p><q> dug: actually, there are a couple of german chaps upstairs who like to test the structural integrity of my ceiling... </q></p>
