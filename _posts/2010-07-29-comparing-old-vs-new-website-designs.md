Setup guide from Google Website Optimizer on the subject of testing old versus new.<br />I dont think this fits with current model at dsgi but provides useful articles in interpreting test results going forward.<br /><br /><div><a href="http://www.google.com/support/websiteoptimizer/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=93319">Google Website Optimiser</a></div><div><br /><p>Content:<br /></p><p>Redesigning your website is a major undertaking, and can have a huge effect on
your conversions. If done by an outside agency, it can also cost thousands of dollars,
so you want to be sure that the new design is really working for you. Website Optimizer
can measure this.</p>
<p>Before pulling down your old site and replacing it with the new, run an experiment
pitting the two versions against each other. To do so:</p>
<ol><li> Upload your new site into a subdirectory (eg. <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;">www.example.com/newsite/</span>).
You may wish to prevent search engine crawling of this directory, through
the use of a <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=40360">robots.txt</a> file. You should also make sure that users are not
able to navigate between your two sites (eg. new product detail pages linking
to your old site's privacy policy page), or your experiment may fail.</li><li> Create a new A/B experiment in Website Optimizer.</li><li> In the A/B setup, enter your old site's URL in the <strong>Original
page URL</strong> field.
Your new site's URL goes into the <strong>Page variation URL</strong> field.</li><li> In the <strong>Conversion page URL</strong> field, enter the conversion page for your old site.
You'll identify your new site's conversion page later, by adding conversion
code to that page.</li><li> When adding the Website Optimizer code to your pages:</li><br /><ul><li><strong>Original page</strong> code: add
this to your <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;">old</span> site's landing page</li><li><strong>Variation pages</strong> code: add to your <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;">new</span> site's
landing page</li><li><strong>Conversion page</strong> code: add this to <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;">both</span> your new and your old sites'
conversion pages.</li></ul></ol>
This experiment setup will serve your old site to one group of visitors, and your
new site to the remaining visitors. With enough traffic, you'll soon be able to
measure the improvements you've wrought with your site's redesign.</div>
