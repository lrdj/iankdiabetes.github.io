<p>A nice man called <a href="http://www.lukejackson.com/">Luke Jackson</a> sent me the following email:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey Dug,</p>

<p>As a London-based blogger I thought you might enjoy the animated video for my new single "Goodbye London".</p>

<p>It was animated onto photos of Camden, Hampstead Heath, Piccadilly Circus and other favourite parts of London.</p>

<p>I'd be delighted if you'd help me spread the word by posting it on your blog, Facebook, Twitter or myspace.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br />
Luke</p></blockquote>

<p>Darn, now that's what I call asking nicely. Have a look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8nrDz1xNFE">his video</a> it's good crack and the animation is fun too:-)</p>
