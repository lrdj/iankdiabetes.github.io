<p>Spent Sat eve and Sunday on the Suffolk coast. Beatiful big sky on the way up. The flat landscape, half reclaimed fenland and half North Sea make for some serious oil painting vistas. Had fish and chips for breakfast on Monday before driving back to London. Unfortunately best fish and chip shop in world closed Mondays. Best pub in world was open for business but I figured Adnams not a good combination with driving.</p>

<p>Stopped by abandoned <span class="caps">WW2 </span>airfield at Glemham Hall on way back. Radio mast has fabulous "approaching, entering, etc., a prohibited place" sign usually reserved for serious cold war relics.</p>
