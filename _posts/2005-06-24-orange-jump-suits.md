<p>Just bumped into this quote from <a href="http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/voltaire.htm">Voltaire</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR510632005">commit atrocities</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Chillingly <a href="http://www.pxdirect.com/inmate_u.htm">current</a> for a guy who died 227 years ago...</p>
