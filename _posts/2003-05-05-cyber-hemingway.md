<p>Do you ever get the feeling that the bloggosphere is turning into Hemingway's <cite>A Moveable Feast</cite>? The more I read blogs, the more I get the impression everyone is talking about the same ten people. We've all started name-dropping like nobody's business and it's made worse by use of first names only as in:</p>

<blockquote><p>So we were in San Jos&eacute; for <span class="caps">ABCX </span>when Ben mentioned to Cory that his new book sucked. Turns out Tom was there too, so we shared sushi with him and Cal...</p></blockquote>

<p>I find myself doing this more and more and I've never met these people (ok, so Tom was at the <span class="caps">RMS </span>talk on copyright at the <span class="caps">LSE</span>). (arrrgggg!)</p>
