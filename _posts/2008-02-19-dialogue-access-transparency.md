<p>I've been following the birth of the Tesla roadster and this morning <a title="Hanging out with a fast company (emphasis on fast)" href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/02/19/hanging-out-with-a-fast-company-emphasis-on-fast/">Scobble</a> twittered his test drive in the first production car with the company <span class="caps">CEO.</span> Things have really been moving along and the <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">Tesla Motors website</a> has been updated with lots of juicy stuff. </p>

<p>The item that I am listening to right now is an mp3 of the January 2008 <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/mm/tesla_town_hall.mp3">Tesla Town Hall</a> meeting (I've grabbed the file so the link stays valid). This is just great, it's all the senior management giving a report and answering questions from the leading lights in the EV business. Dry as hell but very interesting if you're curious about the inner workings of a business that is trying to kick-start the EV revolution by producing road-legal, safe and of course high-performance cars in large enough numbers to make them a valid alternative.</p>

<p>The recording includes the <span class="caps">CEO </span>talking to disappointed customers (length of waiting list), goes into technical details about gearbox design and even covers comments and questions from individuals who put $50,000 money down for a car who aren't being allowed to become investors (I know if I put that kind of money down as a deposit I'd be wanting a little love). This is live dialogue and certainly shows access.</p>

<p>Of course, it doesn't hurt that the Tesla out-performs most petrol-powered super cars (including the McLarren F1 at some speeds).</p>
