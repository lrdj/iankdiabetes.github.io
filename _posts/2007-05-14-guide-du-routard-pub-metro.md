<p>This photo really doesn't do the quality of the repro or indeed the quality of the original photograph justice. It's taken with a Nokia 6300 in the Paris Metro.</p>

<p>France may not be a force for innovation right now but I keep spotting print ads in the Metro that are just beautiful. There's an <a href="http://www.strategies.fr/archives/1439/page_39828/">ongoing campaign for the Bon Marché</a> department store which has classic-but-mesmerising photography (and repro)... The campaigns tend to be very 'old fashioned' in the sense that the ads obey 1960's ad rules (the headline and visual take on a new meaning when seen in partnership and neither repeats the other as in "think small" or "so here's a tart on a bar" etc).</p>

<p>The above ad for the <a href="http://www.routard.com/">Guide du Routard</a> is a case in point, the headline reads "notre guide on l'écrit avec nos pieds" which I guess would translate to "we write our guide with our feet". No paradigms being redefined, but lovely, quiet work:-)</p>
