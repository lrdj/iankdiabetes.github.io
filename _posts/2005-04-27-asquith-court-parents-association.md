<p>There has been a real <a href="http://www.asquithparents.com/westhampstead/">grassroots effort</a> by the parents of kids at Asquith Court West Hampstead. It got so bad we moved <span class="caps">CLF </span>to a new nursery (which she calls her "new nursery" which is kinda cute...).</p>

<p>It's amazing to see what a group of pissed-off mums can achieve once they start communicating.</p>

<p>If your child is at an Asquith school or nursery, you should consider setting-up a parents association. We've listed all the Asquith nurseries who have a parent's blog at the <a href="http://www.asquithparents.com/">main association website</a> if you'd like a site set up (free to parent's associations) <a href="mailto:%64%75%67%40%64%6F%6E%6B%65%79%6F%6E%74%68%65%65%64%67%65%2E%63%6F%6D">email Dug</a></p>
