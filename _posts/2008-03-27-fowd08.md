<p>You know, the last couple of years I've bought conference passes and then failed to escape work long enough to attend which is daft really... so I'm going to fowd this year ok? </p>

<p>Anyways, I signed up on the carson website and was reading the about the speakers (looking forward to hearing <a href="http://www.futureofwebdesign.com/speakers.html#StevePearce">Steve Pearce</a>) when I stumbled on a link to <a href="http://www.headscape.co.uk">Headscape</a> the online home of conference chair <a href="http://www.futureofwebdesign.com/speakers.html#PaulBoag">Paul Boag</a>.</p>

<p>Now, Nicky always has to explain jokes to me and I'm never sure if people are serious or not and this gets worse as I get older... So I'm gonna take a punt: I think headscape could do better. A lot better.</p>
