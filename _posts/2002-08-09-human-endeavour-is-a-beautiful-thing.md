<p>When i was a little boy of about seven or eight (I'm guessing) my father sat me down with his sample books and started teaching me letterforms. The one I remember most clearly was Poster Bodoni Italic. I loved the slanted shapes and learned to trace, then draw them freehand, eventually lettering lowercase forms between two lines to mark the x-height.</p>

<p>I now have my own collection of sample books, most of them from type shops now gone the way of the steam engine. Some day I'll scan some pages and say some words about Fred, Ed, Eric and Adrian, but that wasn't the point of this post.</p>

<p>I had forgotten about <a href="http://www.sewwrong.com/">sewwrong</a>. I regularly visit <a href="http://www.dollarshort.org/">Mena Trott</a> but only infrequently stop by sew wrong. It's a sewing blog, with howtos, projects and pictures posted by a small community of seamstresses. I couldn't sew on a button if my life depended on it but the sheer industriousness of the whole project fascinates me:-)</p>

<p>I might even test drive a thimble one of these days.</p>
