<p><em>(there is also "infrared" but it weren't very nice)</em></p>

<p>Aside from the absurdity of camelCaps in blog post titles, isn't the <a href="http://digg.com/apple/iPhone_CameraBag_App">camerabag</a> iPhone app groovy? I mean I've hated the iPhone camera from the start and this was compounded by the zero quality improvement in the iPhone 3G release but this app somehow manages to make taking rubbish quality digital photographs fun again. It's a bit like using the Nokia 6600 for the first time...</p>
