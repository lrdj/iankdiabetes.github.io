<p>A shitty day</p>

<p><q>...a copy of the Wall Street Journal (hotel bars never keep The Economist), a double measure of Talisker with water (no ice) and a Hoyo De Monterey double corona (clipped) as soon as you like...</q></p>

<p>Once upon a time in a land far far away, I read a review (Gault et Milliaut) of all the finest restaurant in Paris. The idea was to walk into all the (five or six I think it was&mdash;the Tour d'Argent and the Grand V&eacute;fors were among them) three-starred restaurants in town and order a glass of tap water and an omelete. The results were enlightening, the Td'A was clearly not a place you wanted to try it on (nor Maxime's at the time) and on the whole the three-star establishments didn't fare terribly well. I seem to remember two (2) restaurants met the challenge and they were the best ham &amp; eggs the reviewer had ever eaten...</p>

<p>Cut to the Churchill Hotel cigar bar, Portman Square, London, 17:18 on Wednesday, 16 October 2002. The nose-feel of the H de M is good&mdash;peppery but light, the tobacco equivalent of a good Saint Emillion except that since I'm a pleb I couldn't name a good St E vintage&mdash;but you get the idea&mdash;all manner of good things rushing through your body, well balanced and a step closer to Heaven.</p>

<p><q>Victim of the sniper</q></p>

<p>Our trusty barman has met the challenge, I suppose the London Evening standard isn't the <span class="caps">WSJ </span>but hey, it's the thought that counts.</p>

<p>At the door of this place I paused, and thought <cite>you're feeling sorry for yourself</cite> and figured I should go home to Nicki and be a man. Ok, I'm fallible, I'm a sucker for comfort&mdash;I went for the Talisker even though it doesn't appear on the Atkins menu. But six O'clock is rolling along and I should head for home (as I cook meals)...</p>

<p>Apologies to readers, I'm using you guys as my personal Loraine Bracko&mdash;normal service to return any second now:-)</p>
