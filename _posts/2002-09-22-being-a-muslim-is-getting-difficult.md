<p>Came accross this site (in French) as a result of searching my referer logs. Some assumption-challenging stuff here, from the perspective of a Muslim living in a Western country&mdash;things like problems with <a href="http://www.aceiweb.org/apprendre.htm">what they teach our kids in school</a>, <a href="http://www.aceiweb.org/conversion.htm">becoming a Muslim</a> as well as a number of interesting <a href="http://www.aceiweb.org/imanesuite.htm">personal histories</a>.</p>
