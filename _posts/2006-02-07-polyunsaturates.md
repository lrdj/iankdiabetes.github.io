<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/food/a_good_source_of_polyunsaturates.html">Dug asks</a> whether or not polyunsaturated fats are good for you. He quotes <a href="http://www.florahearts.co.uk/">a site</a> he has been working on, and in particular, the <a href="http://www.florahearts.co.uk/livingforahealthyheart/healthyeating/fats.aspx?style=1">page about fats</a> from the same site.</p>

<p>Well... </p>

<p>About polyunsaturates. I wonder if the bad stuff is actually about hydrogenation, which is the process used to increase shelf-life on polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)--it creates trans fatty acids which are bad. Also, when some polyunsaturated fats are heated to a high heat, the chemical structure changes and they act like saturated fats, which is also bad. But, n-3 fatty acids are <span class="caps">PUFA</span>s (in fatty fish such as mackerel, sardines, tuna, cod, etc.) and in some circles, they are thought to be the new wonder nutrient, and wide ranging. Involving blood pressure, cardiac function, cardiac electrophysiology, anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory--all of which are good. I'm convinced I must say.</p>

<p>It might be the trans fat issue that some have been worried about. </p>

<p>Legislation has recently come about in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span>--trans fats now must be recorded on <s>all</s> some food labels. However, yes, there is a loophole. Evidentally restaurants don't need to display same which means <span class="caps">FAST FOOD </span>restaurants such as <em>you know who</em>, can pretend the new law doesn't exist! </p>

<p>Having said all that, caution still needs to be heeded with the consumption with n-3s, because although n-3s are good, they are still fats and if too much of them are consumed there's the whole obesity argument to contend with.</p>

<p>So that's that really.</p></blockquote>
