<p>I've been trying to get Nick interested in personal branding after listening to  <a href="http://twitter.com/garyvee">@garyvee</a> at Seed3. Gary made a bunch of interesting points and got me thinking about how Nick should develop on her work so far as a journalist. The woman has huge amounts of life experience and when fueled, can tell many an exotic tale of Argentinean vineyards, Tuscan raw-food cooking or tea tasting in the Indian Ocean...</p>

<p>Tim <a href="http://timkitchin.com/2008/05/29/beyond-celebrity-pimping-glasshouse-gets-into-personal-branding/">says</a></p>

<blockquote><p>...and translate it into an action model for your personal bottom line--how your brand will generate personal wealth ( Me Inc. ) and how you will create social impact ( Me.org )...</p></blockquote>

<p>Which really resonated... Does Nick settle on a business partner or employer who can work with her to create value using whatever existing methods they might have in place and picking and choosing from a small selection of Nicki's mojo as required?</p>

<p>Or does she choose to leverage her whole experience and develop on her own, working to distribute her mojo-assets socially to a large audience?</p>

<p>I can't help thinking that option one sounds like a bit of a waste...</p>
