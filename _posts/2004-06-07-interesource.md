<p>Just met some really nice people at a studio in the city.</p>

<p>They're developing a site for a UK charity and are developing a new methodology to keep the design fresh without development getting bogged down by <a href="http://bobby.watchfire.com/">Bobby</a> compliance. We had quite an interesting chat about the process. More on this later...</p>
