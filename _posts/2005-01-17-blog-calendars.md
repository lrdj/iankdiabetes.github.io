<p>You know, I put that calendar up there on the right because I could. I mean when I moved to Movabletype, the calendar seemed fun and possibly useful.</p>

<p>I'm beginning to think it's not a terribly useful navigation device, but have you ever noticed the patterns? There's a relationship between how you feel, how often and when you post, and the actual pattern of orange dots on the calendar. Not sure what this means, but I like it:-)</p>
