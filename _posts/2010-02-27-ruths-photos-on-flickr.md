<p>Thanks to all the folk who are sending in wishes. I need to apologise for not getting back to you, I don't get reception in Budleigh on my work mobile so communication is very patchy. We're saying goodbye to Ruth at Jobbles Wood in a few days time and if you want to send Jed some thoughts and wishes, his email is <a href="mailto:%6A%65%64%40%66%61%6C%62%79%2E%6F%72%67">jed@falby.org</a></p>
