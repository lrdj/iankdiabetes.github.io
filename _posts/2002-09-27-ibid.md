<p>Have just re-discovered <a href="http://www.ibidphoto.com/">a photo library</a> I used when I worked in New York. They're called <span class="caps">IBID.</span> They were the first to organise photoshoots with the specific aim of producing one-half of an ad (the other being the headline, of course).</p>
