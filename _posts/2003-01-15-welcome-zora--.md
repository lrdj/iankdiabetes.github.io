<p><q> ...But enough about that. the real news is that we have a new arrival in this world. <br /> Zora Wilde Bissell was born on Saturday, 9 pounds, 1.2 oz, 20.75 inches. Caroline's water broke at one pm, I tore home from the office, and we were at the hospital by 1:25 pm -- and Zora was born at 3:05 pm. Fast and furious, all natural, a beautiful birth, with Caroline alert and inhabiting the moment. Mother and babe are doing well. we're in that rush of newness, of fierce joy and tiredness, theo is doing great and we all home now. </q></p>

<p>Congrats Bill and Caroline :-)</p>
