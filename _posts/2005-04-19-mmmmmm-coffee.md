Thank you Nicki for the lovely coffee flask I've got on my desk (brought all the way <a href="http://nanlong.en.alibaba.com/product/50044270/50204614/Vacuum_Flasks/Stainless_Steel_Travel_Mug.html">Nanlong Corporation's</a> factory in Shanghai courtesy of Mr Ikea). At 90p a cup, I'm already saving a fortune ;-)</p>

<p>And in response to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gahjr2000/5796110/">gahjr2000's</a> question, yes it does sort of look like a dildo, albeit a somewhat more 'boy-on-boy' size of dildo...</p>
