<p>Got this a couple of weeks ago from Chris, a man I trust.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Dug,</p>

<p>The running place both we got our kicks from is called Runners Need (<a href="http://www.runnersneed.co.uk">http://www.runnersneed.co.uk</a>), unfortunately as north as their branches are is Camden (with other shops in Holborn and Liverpool street).  All the shops specialise in one thing and one thing only--running kit.  All the people working there are seasoned runners and serious about ensuring you get the right stuff for your foot (I promise they haven't paid me to say any of this...)</p>

<p>They either put you on a treadmill or take you outside and watch you run, how your foot hits the pavement, the pressure exerted, pronation, etc. and then get you to run in a few different types of shoes that cater to how you run.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, I'll be the first to admit I don't know what pronation is but Nicki really needed some running shoes that fit her properly so I sorted out a fitting for her birthday.</p>

<p>Her feedback is that the shoes are not only a perfect fit but just right for what she wants to do with them.</p>

<p>Each customer works with the in-store experts to create unique value. Where do you run? How far, how fast, in what weather? Whether the customer is training for a marathon or simply wants to get better mileage out of her kneecaps, the in-store experts help build an experience with the customer that ultimately adds value for both the store and the runner.</p>

<p>Now so far so good, I only wish the website offered the same value co-creation potential...</p>
