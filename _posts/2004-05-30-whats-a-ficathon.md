<p>I love these people. The following from <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/charlotteu/friends">http:// www.livejournal.com/users/charlotteu/friends</a></p>

<p><q> Do people not care to encourage me to write J/D, or do they not read it because the girl most likely to force gay!Donna on the world wrote it? Or do they just not feedback just 'cause? (I will admit that my Josh/Donna probably isn't as good as those who, you know, actually ship them.) This is something I can never prove definitively, as you can't see how many people read a particular fic. Or how many people liked it. Or how many people are disgusted with you because you make Donna regularly go down on everyone but Josh. </q></p>
