<p>Just got this from Demon, my <span class="caps">ISP </span>of choice for a number of years:</p>

<blockquote><p>Please note that with effect from Tuesday 24th. August the<br />
customer cacheing <span class="caps">DNS </span>servers (158.152.1.43 and .58) will no<br />
longer respond to queries unless they come from a Demon Customer IP address. This will have no effect on the majority of our customers who connect to our services via Dial Up, <span class="caps">ADSL </span>or Leased Line.</p></blockquote>

<p>Is it just me or does this really suck? Are we seeing the first steps towards a non-collaborative network? A network of compatible but segregated virtual spaces? Kind of defeats the whole concept of the internet really (but then that'll just be my parano√Øa kicking in again)...</p>
