<p>A day of down-and-dirty muddy protest</p>

<p>14:20 Pile wife and baby into <span class="caps">SUV</span></p>

<p>14:50 Arrive at Marble Arch, one block away from anti-war protest&mdash;park legally on meter</p>

<p>15:15 Walk over to Hyde Park and listen to Tony 'God' Benn (who should have been prime-minister since 1960 but wasn't) speak to assembled marchers in hide park</p>

<p>15:30 Listen to Charles Kennedy except that the guy with the megaphone by the "Mecca Cola" float is drowning out the main-stage pa system...</p>

<p>15:45 Bump into 5-month-pregnant Georgia and Stefan who have cycled over from Islington between the footie and the rugger</p>

<p>16:00 Head back to car via Belgian chocolate boutique on Seymour Place</p>

<p>16:20 Swing by Panzer's in St John's Wood for watercress</p>

<p>16:30 Home</p>

<p>I can't believe the day turned out like that... it sort of just happened;-)</p>

<p>Am currently a little tipsy as have just returned from dinner with Piers and friends to celebrate his fortieth birthday. Will attempt coherent post tomorrow am (seeing as the entire UK blogging community has already posted I/05/as well take my time...).</p>
