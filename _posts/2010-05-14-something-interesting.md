<p>This infographic is taken from Ed Tufte's ultra mega super duper important work <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> and describes several different data ranges (geolocation, temperature, number of men) which combine to describe the terrible impact of Napoleon's march on Moscow.</p>

<p>It strikes me as we think about baskets and delivery systems that if an engineer can pull something like this off in 1869 we should be able to do something similar:-)</p>

<p>As I was looking for the link above I came across this <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10278643">article in The Economist</a> which show many other useful examples.</p>

<p>Interesting also that Tufte is working in the Obama administration. They've just migrated <a href="http://recovery.gov">recovery.gov</a> to the cloud (thinking about our own lack of dev/uat/staging/deploy server system) and a look at the site really speaks volumes about Tufte's work on information display over the years.</p>
