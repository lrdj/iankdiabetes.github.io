<p>I think <a href="http://www.cancergiggles.blog-city.com/">this chap</a> has been reading Donkey for a while, and now that comments are on he's even said hi. I thought I'd mention his blog, <em>cancergiggles</em> because it's one of those look-in-your-referrer-logs-and-be-pleasantly-surprised kind of things.</p>
