<p>Well, Nicki got me the box set of Star Trek (The Original Series) for my birthday and it's been sitting on the shelf ever since... Anyway, I'm here on my own and have just watched four episodes in a row :-)</p>

<p>On a side note, the box set (and dig that groovy packaging) has the episodes divided among the disks in a seemingly random order. To complicate matters further, there is no indication of episode order on the disks themselves, the liner notes or anywhere else in the packaging. To get the episode sequence, you have to load each disk and look at it's menu. I'm still trying to work out if this is a very clever editorial layout (similarly significant episodes grouped thematically or something like that) or just a major cock-up in production?</p>
