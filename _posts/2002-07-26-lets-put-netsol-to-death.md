<p>This from <a href="http://boingboing.net/">http://boingboing.net/</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Let's put NetSol to death. We're the Alpha Geeks of our social circles. When people ask us about registering domains, let's be sure to tell them to register anywhere except NetSol, because they will sell your domain to someone else and do nothing about it. When we attend conferences where NetSol or Verisign execs are speaking, let's hijack the <span class="caps">Q&amp;A </span>and hound them about why we should trust them when they so cavalierly robbed hoopla.com's owner of her property. If NetSol resolves this issue (ha!), then ask pointed questions about why it took such a massive putsch to get them to do the right goddamned thing. If you're at an <span class="caps">ICANN </span>meeting, raise hoopla.com and your own horror stories and demand that NetSol be stripped of its charter. Tell your company to certify with companies other than Verisign.</p></blockquote>

<p>Netsol's whois search returns the following:</p>

<p>Expiry Date: 6/10/2003<br /> Registrant<br /> Yi-Chi Wang<br /> Wang Yi-Chi<br /> 3F, No. 1-2, Alley 23, Lane 10, Bau-Jian Rd.<br /> Junghe, TW<br /> 106</p>

<p>Talk about a fucking meltdown &mdash; this is like santa coming 'round on boxing day to take your presents away :-(</p>
