<p>Well, we're still all coldy (CLF coughing in the middle of the night via monitor is just sooo pitiful sounding) and Nick and I are still at each other's throats, but we had lovely day yesterday. We took a long walk (Esther Ranzen shops in the O2 centre Homebase) and had a good chat which felt really good in the end. Hopefully the new office will be sorted soon and out life will get slightly more back to normal.</p>

<p>Last night <span class="caps">CLF </span>had very major tooth pain and essentially screamed bloody murder all night. Nick and I took turns squeezing, bouncing and singing until the wee hours. She finally went to sleep after breakfast for her 08:30 nap. Boy, no fun, the worst part is you know she's hurting but you can't do anything about it.</p>

<p>On the topic of all night stress and distress, if you're a young parent and want help, check out <a href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/"><span class="caps">NHS</span> Direct</a> (0845 4647). They are fantastic. It works like traditional 'expert systems' were supposed to work. Your call is filtered by an initial call-centre handler, you then hang up and a specialist calls you back almost straight away. Very impressive, and publicly funded too:-)</p>
