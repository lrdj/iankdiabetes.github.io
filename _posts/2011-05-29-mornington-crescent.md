<p>Hal never ceases to surprise me. The other morning he corners me and demands we play his new game he's just invented. He spends at least 15 minutes explaining what dots mean and how you rub random bits out with your finger and that impacts your performance and the points out the final destination stop. First person to get there wins but the point of the game is random and is just about drawing interesting shapes, arguing about the rules and just generally enjoying the delightful complexity of the thing.</p>

<p>He's 5 so I dread to think what's next:-)</p>
