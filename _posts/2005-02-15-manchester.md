<p>We did a day trip to Manchester this Saturday to pick the little girl up. <span class="caps">CLF </span>spent the week with her cousins Holly, Tom and Eve while Nicki was in Hong Kong and it looks like she barely noticed her parents were missing. Saturday was Eve's birthday and I grabbed some snaps at the party. Not meaning to get all Dianne Arbus or nothin but I love this photograph:-)</p>
