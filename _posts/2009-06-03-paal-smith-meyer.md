<p>Just had the most amazing chat with Lego's Paal Smith-Meyer (see <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.02/lego.html?pg=1&amp;topic=lego">wired article</a> on Mindstorm project)</p>

<blockquote><p>But the boldest part of the Mindstorms overhaul is Lego's decision to outsource its innovation to a panel of citizen developers. Relying on the <span class="caps">MUP </span>is a gamble that Lego hopes will lead not only to a better product but also to a tighter, more trusting bond between corporation and customer.</p></blockquote>

<p>He's a super nice chap and at the end of our hour he stuck around for more questions (Mark and I had about a jillion each so no worries there...). </p>

<p>It's kinda weird, I've spent so much time talking about Mindstorm with clients the project feels so familiar. I guess it would be like an architecture student getting to spend an hour discussing the the relative merits and design strategies that went into Falling Waters with Frank Lloyd-Wright...</p>

<p>Mmmmm buzzing :-)</p>
