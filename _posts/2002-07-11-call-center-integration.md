<p>Very impressed with Tomy UK (the people who make those funny radio powered baby monitor things). I thought mine was broken as its flashing light morse code alarm was doing what I thought was the wrong thing. I checked out the web site looking for a plain and simple tech spec on the alarm codes but couldn't get anywhere. The site is all Flash and content free - a real load of poo <em>but</em> to my surprise, when you fill in the "contact us" form (why nasty comments about the site from concerned parents etc etc) they then <em>call you back soon after submitting the form</em></p>

<p>So much for Mr Ecrm ;-)</p>
