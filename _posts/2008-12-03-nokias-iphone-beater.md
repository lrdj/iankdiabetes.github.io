<p>Well, not exactly... I wish Nokia all the best, but I've got a couple questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>In my experience, v1 Nokia Symbian firmware is always rough (I suspect there is internal pressure to release new devices from groups that think more in terms of hand-feel and physical device than software-led user experience). Both my <span class="caps">N73 </span>and my <span class="caps">N95 </span>were essentially unusable out of the box (unusable = requiring a hard reset more than one per 15 minutes). They <strong>do</strong> get better but if you want to go after iPhone customers you're going to need the software to work pretty much straight away. In the case of the <span class="caps">N97, </span>an early-ish 2009 launch in restricted markets (USA) means that in reality, us Europeans won't have a good <span class="caps">N97</span>-based user experience until Q1 2010 by which time Android will have a wider developer pool and Apple may well have come up with even more challenging goodies</li>
<li>I'm surprised to read that Nokia can't use multi-touch and that Apple has a patent on the process. I thought the system was developed by <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/jeff_han_demos_his_breakthrough_touchscreen.html">Jeff Han</a> at <span class="caps">NYU </span>and later developed into a shippable product by his own company? I guess not, if anyone can fill in those blanks I'd be curious to hear.</li>
<li>How social is the social? I'd love to hear more about the value-creation network Nokia is proposing to set up with the <span class="caps">N97 </span>as a hub. Also, will the social survive the firmware? I guess we'll see.</li>
</ul>
