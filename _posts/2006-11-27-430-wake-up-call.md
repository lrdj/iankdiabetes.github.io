<p>Great morning, was up til all hours looking for missing passport, sorting IT (or should be IS) bollocks and just generally not managing to get to sleep. Then up at 04:30 and into the shower where with a head full of Pantene's finest (I think it was), the boiler decided to stop making hot water. Enjoyed military standard ice-cold shower (note to self: write to Pantene product development types about ability to rinse out product in sub-zero temp. water) and finally escaped the house's gravity at 5:30.</p>
