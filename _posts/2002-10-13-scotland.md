<p>Well, it had to happen, on Wednesday night I grabbed a bag and ran out of the house leaving a pile of smelly dishes and the cat behind me. I got to Dunblane (that's a place in Scotland, which is not next to Mexico) at 02:30 which isn't bad really, something like a seven hour drive.</p>

<p>Thanks to the modern miracle of cruise control ('ha' I hear you snort but no, really, cruise control rocks) I was able to do Scotland and back without any negative side effects. Normally my right leg seizes up and it takes me a day to recover. Anyway, I'm sold on large comfy automobiles.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the time squeezing little <span class="caps">CLF, </span>so on the whole quite a good week. Yesterday, she managed to push herself along on her knees, which was quite a milestone, except she hasn't quite mastered her front half, so in this instance, she slid along on her nose;-)</p>

<p>On a wholly unrelated topic, here's a link to <a href="http://www.kpmg.com"><span class="caps">KPMG</span></a></p>
