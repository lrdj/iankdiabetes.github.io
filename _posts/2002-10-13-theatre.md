<p>Tuesday evening...</p>

<p><em>19:00</em> leave house excited to be seeing two great actors do their thing on the West End stage.<br /> <em>19:25</em> Arrive at Comedy Theatre Panton Street and find my seat (center of front row stalls, best seat in house etc.)<br /> <em>19:30</em> Realise that both my legs are occupying the seats on either side of me and remember why I can't go to a West End theatre without Nicki who always cedes her legroom<br /> <em>19:35</em> Stand up and walk out of theatre<br /> <em>20:00</em> Get home and feel very depressed</p>

<p>Not a good evening:-(</p>
