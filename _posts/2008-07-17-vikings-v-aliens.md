(that's our in-house Viking H on the big-boy climbing frame over there on the left for our family readers)</p>

<p>As Eva Metalios puts it:</p>

<blockquote><p>Subject: Fw: Dirk needs our help<br />
Hey all -<br />
After working in the Sisyphean task of being a writer in LA for over two decades, and the three year odyssey that <span class="caps">OUTLANDER </span>took to actually be made, the movie our friend Dirk Blackman (Columbia class of '85) authored with his partner and the project's director Howard McCain, is coming out.  It is a sci-fi take on the Beowulf legend, nach.</p>

<p>C'mon, we are talking Dirk here.  This is not<br />
your daddy's Viking movie.</p></blockquote>

<p>And Charlotte makes the point</p>

<blockquote><p>Douglas,<br />
the Norway thing, the Columbia thing, the media thing...</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, yes, she's got a point I guess (and only Charlotte and my mother can get away with  calling me <em>Douglas</em>). </p>

<p>The Norway thing huh? well we named our boy H in an attempt to ping him into investigating his Norse roots... He is named after King Healfdene (lit. "half-dane") whose name has survived from myth into modern Danish under the popular form <em>Halfdan</em></p>

<p>I initially wanted to call Hal Healfdene but worrying got the better of me and in the end I didn't want to relive <em>a boy named Sue</em> so tried to anglicise it some. We could have gone with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfdan">Haldan</a>, also in use in modern Danish but in the end we settled on H (also good because it's a Scottish name).</p>

<p>Oh, right, back to the link love;-)</p>

<li>the Morwen character is in development here: <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/672643/EXCLUSIVE_Outlander_Design_Preview.html">G4 video</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/hhg/">Healfdene Goguen</a> is as far as I can tell the only man online to sport the BW original spelling</li>
<li>and <a href="http://outlander.solsector.net/">here's</a> another site about Outlander</li>
<li>here's the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewBIp8uv58I">trailer on Youtube</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Judging from the amount of traffic already generated, Dirk's project doesn't need any help but I liked Eva's closer <em>make the Weinstein Company to feel the noise.  Take that Harvey!</em></p>
