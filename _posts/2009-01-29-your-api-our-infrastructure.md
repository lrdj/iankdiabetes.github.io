<p>Wow, and an interesting business model too... Or interesting way of expressing the business model. I can imagine how this could be the beginning of a fair split of value in a post-IP world (as long as everybody knows what everybody else is in it for that could work...) </p>

<p>It's also a nice, scalable way to express the fruitful partnership between state-run monopoly and tiny creative shop (imagine if Orange and Shozu had decided to divvy things up like this, some beautiful experiences might have come out of it)</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.mashery.com/solution/">mashery</a> site:</p>

<blockquote><p>An <span class="caps">API </span>can unlock new distribution channels for your content and services. But creating an <span class="caps">API </span>is only the first step. Achieving long-term success requires management tools, security controls, built-in scalability, and community support.</p></blockquote>
