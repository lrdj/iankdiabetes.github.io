<p>Look around your office, now imagine being a part of this <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2010/02/a_new_global_visual_language_f.html">massive redesign</a></p>

<blockquote><p>We set out to broaden our ambitions; to create a design philosophy and world-class design standards that all designers across the business could adhere to. We wanted to find the soul of the <span class="caps">BBC.</span> We wanted something distinctive and recognisable; we wanted drama. We knew whatever we created needed to be truly cross-platform and that we needed to simplify our user journeys.</p>

<p>Together, over the last four months, we've spent countless hours and created countless iterations of designs, components, mastheads, footers, polar maps, word documents, pdfs and grids... and whilst it's still a work in progress, I'd like to share with you where we're at with both the design philosophy and the latest version of our global visual language styleguide.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh to have a license-payer's fee eh? Oh, to have a thinking space with a wall big enough to share and iterate over the big picture...</p>

<p>I'm glad Neville Brody is keeping busy and lovely stuff and top marks all around to the <span class="caps">BBC </span>but I'm reminded of <a href="http://mediajunkie.com/2010/talking-social-patterns-with-thriving-ux-communities-in-london-and-berlin/">a talk I just attended</a> where Christian Crumlish made an interesting point:</p>

<p>Pattern libraries are more useful, more engaging and have a greater longevity in the enterprise than design guidelines.</p>

<p>I think his point is that most styleguides start becoming obsolete the moment you complete them. Clearly a large and complex design resource needs guidelines, but I think Christian felt that giving a team a system of patterns and the understanding of the user needs they satisfy was a bit like teaching a man to fish instead of handing him a tuna steak.</p>
