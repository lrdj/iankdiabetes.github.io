Nicki kept her medicated all afternoon and put her to bed early. </p>

<p>Last night was rough--most problems you sort of know what to do, but when your kid starts whimpering and clutching her tummy the choices are peppermint tea or a trip to the <span class="caps">ER.</span> So 3am it was a little touch-and-go but she's sort of settled now. </p>

<p>Still pitiful and heavily medicated, <span class="caps">CLF </span>is hugging baby Anabel (Charlie, Mary?) and watching Mary Poppins...</p>
