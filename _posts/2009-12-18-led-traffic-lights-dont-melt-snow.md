<p><a href="http://twitter.com/bobbywatson">Franco</a> just sent me <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/17/led-traffic-lights-dont-melt-snow-do-cause-accidents/">this utterly wonderful example</a> of what happens when design is divorced from context-of-use:</p>

<blockquote><p>It turns out, perhaps in an homage to bad engineering everywhere, that the <em>inefficiency</em> of incandescent light bulbs was previously relied upon to keep traffic signals unimpeded.</p></blockquote>

<p>Also, there is just something so 'human factors', so deliciously broken about humans relying on what is--on paper--a defect to support their activity. It reminds me we should never assume we fully understand a system, and we certainly shouldn't be afraid to claim that without testing, we can't be sure.</p>

<p>Score +1 for user-centred-design:-)</p>
