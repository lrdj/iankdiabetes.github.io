<p>The Facebook charter states:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users own their data and can remove it when they want</li>
<li>Facebook should publicly make available information about its purpose, plans, policies, and operations</li>
<li>Facebook should have a town hall process of notice and comment and a system of voting to encourage input and discourse on amendments to these Principles or to the Rights and Responsibilities</li>
</ul>

<p>I am so hoping I'm seeing a trend here...</p>
