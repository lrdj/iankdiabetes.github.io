<p>So tomorrow morning little <span class="caps">CLF </span>is going to wake up and be five years old. Forgive the cliché but darn she got big quick... We're at Rebecca and Tim's place near Perpignan (strangely correctly identified on the <span class="caps">N95'</span>s <span class="caps">GPS </span>system) and Jed has just set up a follow-the-string treasure hunt for tomorrow morning.</p>
