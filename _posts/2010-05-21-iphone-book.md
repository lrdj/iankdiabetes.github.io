<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>today I finally cracked. Because I'm an idiot I can't work out how to pull our phone numbers on the Blackberry. I can search for a person but I only get the Hemel extension number which I can't click on to dial.</p>

<p>So I've put our numbers in an iPhone template and have bookmarked it on the iPhone and the BB--so far so good. It'll be interesting to see how the iPhone template holds up...</p>
