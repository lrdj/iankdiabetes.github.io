<p>Client: Orange</p>

<p>Project: European comms product development for Orange and Mobistar business customers.</p>

<p>This project was a joy to run, a real testament to what a small team running Agile methodologies can do even as part of a heavyweight organisation. I had spent the better part of a year managing France Telecom stakeholders on an integrated communications project when I was contacted by the leader of this three-man team.</p>

<p>We worked together (yes, in French), helping dev teams move from waterfall-based production methodology to a user-centred design process built on the Garrett elements of user experience.</p>

<p>Demo: A flash animation is available to <a href="/demos/orangeofficepro.html">view the calendar functions</a></p>

<p>Outcome: The end product was rolled out quickly to the two markets and has been a huge success. After the launch, learnings from this product development were fed back into the France portal which now offers its customers best-in-class converged communications tools.</p>
