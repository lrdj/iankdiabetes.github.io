<p>Love this from <a href="http://twitter.com/doctorow">@doctorow</a> in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/mar/23/copyright-regulate-us?newsfeed=true">theguardian</a></p>

<blockquote><p>...the tautological legitimacy of success: "You are an upstanding firm because you got rich, therefore the way you got rich must be upstanding."</p></blockquote>

<p>And yes, this <strong>is</strong> a little embarrassing having two Doctorow posts in a row. What can I say, the guy is prolific and his content majorly resonates OK;-)</p>
