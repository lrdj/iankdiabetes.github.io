<p>In days of yore, before Donkey was published using movabletype, I wrote an application to publish this blog. Like most of the software I've created, it was pretty rubbish, but in fairness, it did support three growing blogs well enough in the early days.</p>

<p>The thing that started it all off was my trying to get started with Blogger.com (I thought I'd start the easy way) and finding the whole experience really unpleasant. Back then, the javascript (no, not ajax, just unnecessary, crap, pointless and intrusive badly coded javascript) required to use the site wasn't very mac-friendly so I got some unpredictable results.</p>

<p>I was reminded of all this by James Governor (<a title="James Governor's MonkChips: Blogger: The home of spam blogs and suckage" href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/001280.html">James Governor's MonkChips: Blogger: The home of spam blogs and suckage</a>) he reminded me that I can never seem to comment on a Blogger blog because <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/000531.html">No. I. Don't. Want. To. Be. A. Blogger. User.</a> alright?</p>

<p>Anyhow, just wanted to chime in and strongly agree with his point about google's implication in this mess:</p>

<blockquote><p>So Adwords is open to clickfraud, and now Blogger is emerging as the spam bloggers friend... Come on Google you can surely do better. Why not put some of those geniuses to work solving existing customer problems rather than inventing the future behind the GoogleWall?</p></blockquote>
