<p>Bit of a weird moment there - I got in the bath and everything slowed down, or at least it was so dreamy in the bath I couldn't feel the contractions. So I went to bed and they kicked in again with a vengeance. Now they are every seven mins, lasting about 45 secs - 1 min and definitely stronger. Duggie attached the <span class="caps">TENS </span>machine so we'll see how that goes - we might have left it too late - it's supposed to go on from the off, but frankly I'm glad I had the bath. Still no broken waters - I am now ruffing the script for that soap in my head.</p>
