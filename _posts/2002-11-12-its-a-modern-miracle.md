<p>Have you ever wondered what the difference is between a 'server' and a 'workstation'? You know, you need to buy a machine and are flicking through those little Dabsdirect catalogues that seem to multiply on you doorstep and you wonder...</p>

<p>Anyway, apparently, the core OS is different, something about managing large amounts of file connections over a network (yawn). So after last month's lightning strike (three surge-protected workstations buggered) and this month's fabulous dying powerbook (the machine I use to post to this blog&mdash;excuses, I know...) I find myself working on our staging server:-(</p>

<p>And this is bad. Something you're not supposed to do. But I haven't got an alternative while I wait for the insurance to sort it out. But I have to say, this thing is running my entire design environment (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, 1000's of fonts etc) on top of a busy file service which not only serves Quicktime Streaming video and Appleshare/Samba/nfs file services but is also serving busy web-based applications running in Apache/Perl. Or in other words, I'm sitting at a computer that actually works better than expected:-)</p>
