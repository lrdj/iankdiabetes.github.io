<p>I was following a link from <a href="http://www.openbrackets.com/">Gail's</a> very funny piece on the <a href="http://www.openbrackets.com/article/631/cli183ch233">cli&middot;ché</a> and ended up at The Telegraph (she linked to <a href="http://www.arts.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2004%2F08%2F08%2Fbocliche.xml">this piece</a>).</p>

<p>The list of book review clichés was hilarious, but what struck me was this <a href="http://www.arts.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fportal%2Frss%2Fexclusions%2Frssinfo.xml">list of available <span class="caps">RSS </span>feeds</a> -- who'd a thunk it? A major UK broadsheet offering <span class="caps">RSS </span>with the understanding that <em>they might be syndicated</em>. As much as I hate all things Tory, I have to do something to the brim of my cap:-)</p>
