<p>For a theoretically unemployed person, I seem to be very very busy right now. This is great because one of my iBook&#8217;s logic boards (I think it&#8217;s a logic board, due to the little beeps I&#8217;m pretty sure I heard yesterday but ignored&#8212;and decided not to back up my stuff) has just this evening packed up.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very dead&#8212;I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s the logic board <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/dugs_random_musings/ibook_logic_board_repair_extension_programme.html">Apple just replaced</a>. Fingers crossed&#8230;</p>
