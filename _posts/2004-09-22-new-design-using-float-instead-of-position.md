<p>Damn, this thing went from Mena's intermediate template to the completely new float design in about 18 hours. I was at the perifferal templates until 2 am this morning trying to get the category-based tags to work as expected (had to upgrade to 3.11 in the process&#8212;must learn how to psync&#8230;).</p>

<p>I'm off to a small job this morning, but should be able to be back on the case some time early afternoon. The plan is to have the whole thing finished for Monday morning.</p>

<p>I hope this hasn't been too disruptive. The biggest change is that the home page (where you go by typing http://donkeyontheedge.com) is no longer the standard blog page. The usual stream-of-consciousness posts will now live in <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/bray.html">The Bray</a> (you can bookmark this page of course).</p>

<p>If any of this isn't working as expected, feel free to let me know:-)</p>
