<p>I use a service called <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com">campaignmonitor</a> to send emails to clients and prospects (well, not now of course) and they do a really great job of keeping the ideas flowing. They write articles about emails that worked particularly well:</p>

<p><img alt="Panic email" src="/assets/i/panic.jpg" width="530" height="529"  style="" /></p>

<p>And they maintain a really useful <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/gallery/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Emailmarketingsoftware&amp;utm_content=5038312&amp;utm_campaign=AprilNews-VersionB+_+ouklri&amp;utm_term=emaildesigngallery">gallery</a> of work. I you design html emails as part of your day job you could do worse that sign up for their newsletter.</p>
