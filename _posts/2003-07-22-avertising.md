<p>And while I'm on the subject of ads and advertising, I've been soaking in the Charlie's Angels "Full Throttle" poster campaign. The photography is fantastic--as you'd expect from a big Hollywood number--but the art direction is so sensitive. The creatives have managed to find the 'soul' of the Charlie's thing in a big way.</p>

<p>I grew up a million miles away from California in Paris and never worked in a car wash, went surfing or drove muscle cars (though I did make it to a roller-disco in LA in 1979 which was a very strange summer indeed). Even so, I can look at that poster of Drew Barrymore sitting on the bonnet of a soapy caddy in her red jump suit and all sorts of funky associations come swelling up, the hot summers of '75 and '76 when Alain Brouillaud brought his little slice of LA to the Lyc&eacute;e de S&egrave;vres and had us all buying Ohio Players albums (remember the three-gate fold-out "Honey"), or the incessant switching between Donna Summer's "I Feel Love" and Wild Cherry's "Play That Funky Music White Boy (as I type the ellipse I can hear Tom Paulin's voice fade)&hellip;</p>

<p>So yeah, so I haven't seen the movie (baby, work etc) but the advertising has to be better that the film itself;-)</p>
