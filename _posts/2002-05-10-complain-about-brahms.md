<p>is what i did half an hour ago and Nicki put the Beatles' "Let it Be" on the cd player. Wow, I haven't heard that particular album in ages, and you know what, it good, very good. I had forgotten the concept of concept - lots of J Lennon verbals - strange and satisfying (or was that supposed to be strangely satisfying)...</p>
