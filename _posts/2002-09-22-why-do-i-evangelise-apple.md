<p>Man I am getting sick of supporting Apple. I mean it's one long lonely road, you know? I used to believe my box <em>was</em> better than the other guy's windoze machine, but now I'm getting really bored of paying for the same thing over and over. There has to come a point were I just stop. </p>

<p>Nope, I don't need an upgrade. </p>

<p>Really.</p>

<p>I went 'pro' (large fries with that?) by registering my copy of Quicktime three years ago. I would go out of my way to evangelize Quicktime over Realplayer, in several cases, getting QT media included in sites that were just going with Real. So I bought the 'pro' upgrade.</p>

<p>Then when I upgraded to <span class="caps">QT4</span> I had to buy another license. </p>

<p>Same with <span class="caps">QT5</span></p>

<p>Now, having bought two QT license off Apple (you're welcome, <span class="caps">S.J.</span>) I'm looking at <span class="caps">OSX</span> 10.2 and the built-in Quicktime 6. I have to say, the fact that I am now supposed to buy a <em>third</em>, for the <em>same</em> product if I want the damn 'shareware' notice to go away? I would expect that of Bill Gates, but Apple?, why?</p>

<p>I keep getting punished for being an early adopter and frankly, it's getting to me:-( I mean, to compound the Quicktime license problem, I own a once-top-of-the-range powerbook <span class="caps">G3.</span> And guess what, my model shipped with a dodgy <span class="caps">DVD </span>unit (see the <a href="http://discussions.info.apple.com/webx?50@221.0RdqaSFvdtL.0@.ef70b23">class action</a> in the making) which means I can't boot from <span class="caps">CDROM </span>which means the likelihood of my successfully installing Jaguar (stupid name given to <span class="caps">OSX10.2</span>) is pretty much nil anyhow.</p>

<p>arse:-(</p>

<p>Damn it Steve, you should be sending me a copy of 10.2 with a big fat thank you note for my paying talented perl programmers to go overtime creating applications on your unfinished server <span class="caps">OS.</span> Why did I take the extra trouble? Why didn't I just go with openBSD? Tell me why Steve? It's not for Aqua, my servers don't use monitors.</p>

<p>Steve, I bought <span class="caps">OSX</span> 10.0 beta (which felt pretty darn cheeky - I mean charge for a beta?!?) and then I bought the first proper version. I bought <span class="caps">OSX </span>server when it was 1.x (ie a slightly repackaged NextStep). And then, <em>I bought it again</em> when it went to version one. Finally, I shelled out for a copy of 10.1</p>

<p>What do I do now Steve? What advice should I give my customers?</p>
