<p><img src="/assets/i/tw_small.gif" width="160" height="160" alt="Optimism is alive and well in .tw" style="float:left;margin:0 10px 5px 0;border:0;" />Got this piece of spam yesterday and I've been staring at this image ever since then. The expression on the models faces just grabs me. Not sure what's going on--is it a dating service or a mobile <span class="caps">ISP</span>? I just <em>know </em> you'll want to download the <a href="http://donkeyontheedge.com/i/tw_big.jpg">full-size</a> version&hellip;</p>
