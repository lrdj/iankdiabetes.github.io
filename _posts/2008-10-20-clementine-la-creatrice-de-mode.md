<p><span class="caps">CLF </span>has been busy blocking out her Halloween costume. I'm a bit amazed, she drew the hat, the skirt and the cape and is now working with her nanny to make the costume. I've seen an early attempt and it looks just like her drawings... Of course I quite like the idea of her in the <span class="caps">RAF </span>air cadets but I guess dads don't get everything they wish for ;-)</p>
