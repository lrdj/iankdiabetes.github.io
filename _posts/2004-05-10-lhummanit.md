<p>Did my first translation for <a href="http://www.humaniteinenglish.com"><span class="caps">L'H</span>umanit&eacute; in English</a> last night.</p>

<p>Got a last minute email from the site coordinator in Quebec and had something more or less idiomatic ready in under three hours ;-)</p>

<p>Not sure how I feel about this though as the item in question was an editorial re torture in Iraq, and the tone was horrendously pompous. I tried to tone it down as much as possible, but I'm still in two minds about seeing my name next to it (even though, of course, <i>I</i> am incredibly pompous...).</p>

<p>On the plus side, I've learned a new French word: "la g&eacute;g&egrave;ne" (the hand-cranked telephone alternator used to make the old telephone bell ring, as used by the French on the toes and testicles of the good people of Algeria). I don't think I'll be teaching this one to <span class="caps">CLF </span>just yet...</p>
