<p>I wish I had more time to share my thoughts on the current crop of <span class="caps">CSS </span>issues. This from Owen Briggs' excellent website <a href="http://www.thenoodleincident.com/">www.thenoodleincident.com</a> (reprinted here without permission)</p>

<p>"This isn't news to anyone. But the web isn't screen either. Or more accurately it is print, and screen, and voice, and many other things. </p>

<p>Right now it's December 2001 and chances are you're reading this on a PC or a Mac, so you think you're building pages for PC or Mac. Well, just stop. That's going to confuse the heck out of you as you build with <span class="caps">CSS.</span></p>

<p>The idea of the web is to digitalize your message for a variety of retrieval methods -- for methods we have now, and for methods that we haven't thought of yet."</p>

<p>Well told ;-)</p>

<p>My most recent attempts at table-free pages culminated late last year with the re-launch of <a href="http://www.pumpernickle.net/">Pumpernickle's</a> corporate site. Two bizarre issues (or new to me anyway) with that site, I had to manually assign properties to children that should have inherited them automatically and the inconsistencies of type 'zooming' - it seems to be working (try upping and downing your type size) but I haven't been able to describe the behavior in a repeatable way?</p>
