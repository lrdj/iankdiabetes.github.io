<p>I recently started listening to <a href="http://www.wfmu.org/"><span class="caps">WFMU</span></a> again thanks to the miracle of adsl. Can somebody tell me what it is about Alan Watts that make his lectures so impossible to switch off? I know nothing of Buddhism and am not normally drawn to Eastern Mysticism but this guy delivers his wisdom in a particularly funny way. In fact, large parts of the recordings are him chuckling...</p>

<p>Right, am off (in Nicki's shiny new car) to Thorpeness for part II of our family summer hols:-)</p>
