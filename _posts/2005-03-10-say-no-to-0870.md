<p>A co-worker just passed this around:</p>

<blockquote>Rather than call an non-geographical 0870x numbers (minimum 7p/minute) use <a href="http://www.saynoto0870.com/search.php">http://www.saynoto0870.com</a> to find the actual number and only pay for a normal call. 

This has been a public service email.<br />
</blockquote>
 <br />
What a great idea -- Another example of the digital consumer doing it for themselves:-)
