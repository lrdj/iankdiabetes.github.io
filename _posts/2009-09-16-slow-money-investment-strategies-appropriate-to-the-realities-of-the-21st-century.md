<blockquote><p>Paul Newman said, "I just happen to think that in life we need to be a little like the farmer who puts back into the soil what he takes out." Recognizing the wisdom of these words, let us begin rebuilding our economy from the ground up, asking:</p>

<ul>
<li> What would the world be like if we invested 50% of our assets within 50 miles of where we live?</li>
<li> What if there were a new generation of companies that gave away 50% of their profits?</li>
<li> What if there were 50% more organic matter in our soil 50 years from now?</li>
</ul></blockquote>
