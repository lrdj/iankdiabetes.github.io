<p>I think the nice man who went in search of my Identity theft woes last week would have liked me to update my previous post.</p>

<p>So here goes: according to his findings there is nothing wrong with either his payment-processing software or hardware and a review of staff at the branch revealed nothing untoward.</p>

<p>So just to confirm: all is well at Eat. You can pick up your soup and sandwiches safe in the knowledge that these guys pay attention to detail, act fast when required and are just generally a bunch of excellent people!</p>
