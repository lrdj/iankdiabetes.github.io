<p>The world didn't change on 9/11, but it sure as hell did at midnight. This is truly depressing. If the voice of millions (and 139 MPs) can go completely ignored, this means that for the first time in history, the President of the United states now has both the will and the power to act entirely on his own to redraw the map of the world.</p>

<p>US forces invaded the sovereign nation of Iraq with the expressed and explicit aims of changing the government and protecting assets (oil field contracts have been in negotiation for some months and it looks like the <span class="caps">US, </span>as occupying power, gets the lion's share, with France and Russia grabbing the rest).</p>

<p>So what next? What country is soon no longer to be in charge of its own destiny?</p>
