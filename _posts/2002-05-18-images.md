<p>Have just picked up a nifty digital camera (which works with iPhoto, which turns a gimmick into a useful appliance) and have started snapping. In the nav over on the left there's a link to "scrapbook" that's where I'll be keeping pictures.</p>

<p>Of course, as soon as we have pics of junior, I'll upload em</p>
