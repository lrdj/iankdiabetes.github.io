<p>Am sitting here of a Thursday afternoon listening to the conversation at the Scarlet tea party happening in the adjoining desk-space. I don't know when people stopped talking about sex, real-estate or even the weather, but the conversation has centred almost exclusively on eBay for the last hour.</p>
