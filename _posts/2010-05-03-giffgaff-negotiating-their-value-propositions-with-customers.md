GiffGaff is an experiment launched by O2 to test this stuff. The idea is that the baseline service (the quality and hygiene) is provided by the O2 network but the value negotiation is handled by GiffGaff. </p>

<p>The interaction is built on forums where the unique value of the services to each customer is hotly debated between customers and O2 representatives. Key pricing structures and deal offers are negotiated transparently with customers. See for ex. the discussions around new data tariff agreement:</p>
