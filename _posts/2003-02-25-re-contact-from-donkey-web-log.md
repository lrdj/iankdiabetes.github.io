<p>Got the following in the post this morning. I'm always amazed to find out that my Mom isn't my only reader;-)</p>

<p><q> RE: An American Replies <br /> <br /> Hi Dug, <br /> <br /> I don't think you have any responsibility or obligation whatsoever to present a 'balanced' point of view. You are writing in what is (in effect) a personal diary, it is published and public yes, but still personal nevertheless. Do you have ambitions to turn Donkey into the Grauniad? I think not. And what is this 'well-balanced' thing your friend refers to anyway? ;) <br /> <br /> Some people go on marches. Some people write in their weblogs. Some people choose to nothing, and that is fine. My respect goes to those that take a stand. It is (imho) very much a time in which to do so. <br /> <br /> Regards (and respect), <br /> <br /> <a href="http://da5id.com/ ">David Fromant</a><br /> Freelance web, writing, &amp; project management </q></p>

<p>Thanks David. I think the well balanced thing was actually something <em>I</em> said, but I wholeheartedly agree that it is time to take a stand. However great or small your contribution, do something.</p>

<p>Also, Ben has now written back several times and we have argued long into the night (the triple-quoted emails would be impossible to transcribe here as-is). He was surprised to find his letter published, as he says, if he had known, he/05/have phrased things differently. We're going to try and work on a position and we/05/edit his earlier post. More tomorrow about this I think:-)</p>
