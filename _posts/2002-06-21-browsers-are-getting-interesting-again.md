<p>I've just downloaded the new version of <a href="http://wp.netscape.com/computing/download/">netscape</a> &mdash; it has all the down-to-basics functionality of Communicator, but with the added extra of a (largely) standards-compliant rendering engine. Also, my parents should be able to upgrade from 4.73 without losing their profiles, mailboxes and shortcuts (ie without pain). </p>

<p>While Moz 1.0 candidate is nice, there is a Moz branch dedicated to getting interface right for <span class="caps">OSX.</span> It's known as <a href="http://chimera.mozdev.org/">Chimera</a> and I have to say it is nice to have aqua integration on top of Moz rendering. It's only a pre-release version 0.3, but it appears to behave quite well :-)</p>

<p>Now if only the chaps over at <a href="http://www.icab.de">icab</a> could get their <span class="caps">CSS2 </span>implementation finished I'd have a choice of 'perfect' browser.</p>
