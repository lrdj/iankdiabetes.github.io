<p>Given that I have no prior knowledge of gardening beyond the long list of pot plants which I have killed over the years, I thought I'd pay attention and try and observer what is happening out there&#8230;</p>

<li>If you cut the woody stem of French Taragon <em><a href="http://www.rhs.org.uk/Databases/HortDatabase.asp?ID=1632">artemisia dracunculus</a></em> it grows a fork (like a tuning fork).</li>
<li>While growing Common Basil <em><a href="http://www.rhs.org.uk/Databases/HortDatabase.asp?ID=11649">ocimum basilicum</a></em> outside in a London garden seems largely pointless, some plants do seem to soldier on towards winter, getting thicker-skinned and darker as the season progresses. Even in this &#8216;hardened' state, the leaves still make a mean salad (see previous post).</li>
<li>I still don't know how to appropriately describe the soil in my herb garden (<em>shitty, urban,</em> doesn't seem very helpful) but the <a href="http://www.sgaravatti.net/ita/prod/bio/pre53.htm">Prezzemolo Gigante di Napoli</a> that <span class="caps">CLF </span>and I sowed outside at the beginning of August is going strong.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.rhs.org.uk/rhsplantfinder/plantfinder.asp"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">RHS</span></span> Plant Finder</a> (surprisingly) isn't very good if you're looking for a predictable, uniform listing of varieties for the purposes of keeping a gardening diary&#8230;</li>
<li>Aloe Vera is a cactus (ok, you can stop laughing now, but I really didn't know that). You can actually break a &#8216;leaf' off and crack it open to get the goo out, just like the cosmetic stuff&#8212;I'm amazed by the simplest things:-)</li>
