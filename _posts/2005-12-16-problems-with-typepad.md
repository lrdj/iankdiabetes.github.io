I just tried to comment on <a href="http://www.themanwhoinventedtheinternet.com">a blog</a> whose author is taking part in a 'fair and frank' with Anil Dash, SixApart's professional network guy. As luck would have it, when I clicked "Post comment" TypePad <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/i/TPBarf.gif">barfed</a> (so is that coincidence, irony or poetic justice?)</p>

<p>So anyway, thought I'd post the comment here:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think there's a balance where we can reasonably spend our time either fixing things or talking about them...</p></blockquote>

<p>What SixApart are going through isn't new, but it still doesn't justify making this sort of comment.</p>

<p>When you're distributing a cool Perl script made by a handy programmer with an interface cut by his very talented designer partner it's ok to be human.</p>

<p>When you go incorporated, sell commercial licenses to your product, start international offices and set sail to take over the world it's an entirely different matter.</p>

<p>Real companies have departments that build stuff and fix stuff and they also have departments that communicate. In the real world, one doesn't preclude the other.</p>

<p>From a marketing point of view, I feel the pain of a bunch of really cool people trying to do the right thing for the right reasons coming up against the jugernaught of market forces.</p>
