<p>I frequently receive emails at work with reports that measure the value of brands (likely to involve voodoo and pixie dust, but makes a good read). Happily my employer seems to do quite well in these listings, but every time I read them I am reminded of Hugh's <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000823.html">Hughtrain</a> of 2004 and wish I could talk about it at work without sounding like an ideologue. Still, finding a sense of purpose is a fine thing:-)</p>

<p>Here are the first few lines from his archive:</p>


<h2>"THE <span class="caps">MARKET FOR SOMETHING</span> TO <span class="caps">BELIEVE</span> IN IS <span class="caps">INFINITE.</span>"</h2>

<ol>
<li>We are here to find meaning. We are here to help other people do the same. Everything else is secondary.</li>
<li>We humans want to believe in our own species. And we want people, companies and products in our lives that make it easier to do so. That is human nature.</li>
<li>Product benefit doesn't excite us. Belief in humanity and human potential excites us.</li>
<li>Think less about what your product does, and think more about human potential.</li>
<li>What statement about humanity does your product make?</li>
<li>The bigger the statement, the bigger the idea, the bigger your brand will become.</li>
</ol>
