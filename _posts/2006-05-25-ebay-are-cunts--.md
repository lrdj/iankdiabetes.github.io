<p>So I get home at 23:15 last night, check my eBay listing and my bike didn't make the reserve price. Arrrggggg, I need to sell it tonight so I can pick up the new bike tomorrow before going on holiday on Saturday. Quickly, I click on the three top bidders and send them a message.</p>

<p>...ah, a captcha, that's new, probably to prevent spammers or something... Fill in the number and pow, I can't send a message to my buyer because the auction is over. What??? how the hell am I supposed to sell the bike??? (Â£32 later)...</p>

<p>It's getting near midnight and hallelujah, the top bidder sends me a message. He's still very interested and wants to make a deal. <span class="caps">OK,</span> I click on "reply to message", give him my details and wait... another captcha and wham! <span class="caps">THE SAME MESSAGE AARRRRRRRGGGGGG</span>!!!</p>

<p>Bloody hell, there's a trend going on here. Big hosted apps can't afford to monitor or consider individual circumstances. It would cost a fortune to have a human evaluate every message sent on eBay or every click sent to an Adsense server. Instead, these companies work on aggregate (kinda the same way racial prototyping works).</p>

<p>Basically, the way it works is that if you find yourself in a situation where on aggregate a crime takes place then you are arrested, whether or not you had any intention of committing a crime. Aggregate justice is a whole new way to say goodbye to our Eighteenth century friends. Maybe we'll be bringing back the lash next...</p>
