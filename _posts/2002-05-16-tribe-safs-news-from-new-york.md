<p>Got a call last night from a slightly pissed Jos&eacute;-Antonio from a bar in K&ouml;ln - the whole gang was there, Ben and Laura, Bill and Caroline, I think Ado, Robert and Daniel were all going to make the big day.</p>

<p>Darn, I'm going to miss his bloody wedding. Again.</p>

<p>I wonder if you can still send telegrammes (multiplyforthgo - stop - wishesbestyouboth - stop - dugnicklove - stop) from the post office? I guess I'm condemned to never make it to one of Jasr's weddings, but I'm hoping this one is "The" one and will therefore be his last :-)</p>
