<p>I recently lost a couple of people's email messages--they were eaten by my spam rules. Please don't put "dug" in your message subject (though that is my name) as messages with my name in the subject get deleted automatically.</p>

<p>I wonder who (or what) comes up with new subjects for spam. I mean, merging the part of the email address to the left of the "@" sign is just plain lazy. Some clever spammers are composing ever more meaningful or intriguing message subjects which (particularly when getting mail on the mobile) cause me to read the messages.</p>

<p>I would have to say congratulations to those writers of micro-copy (or to their programmers).</p>
