<p>I just love this shit :-)</p>

<p><a title="Virgin Galactic Unveils Design For SpaceShipTwo" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/23/virgin-galactic-unveils-design-for-spaceshiptwo/">Virgin Galactic Unveils Design For SpaceShipTwo</a></p>

<p>We never got the future they promised our parents. To quote Leo McGary: "where's my jet pack?" It's heart warming to see money spent on insane crazy projects like this.</p>

<p>Of course, for his next trick, Richard branson could focus on building a network of major sea defenses for the <span class="caps">UK.</span> The idea would be to protect the land itself against erosion but primarily create a physical support for tidal, wind and wave energy generation...</p>

<p>I mention it because the Dutch started their latest high-tech <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Works">sea defense network</a> after the storm tide of 1954 so they've got a bit of a head-start on us.</p>

<p>That, and they didn't finish until 1997 so c'mon Richard let's get building ;-)</p>
