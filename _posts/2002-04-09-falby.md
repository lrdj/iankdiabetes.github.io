<p>As part of the child naming process, I'm trying to find the first name of the falby that came over from denmark in 890AD (I imagine). I realise this is entirely impossible, but I can dream can't I? My branch of the Falbys continues with the shores of the north sea as my mother is from a Norwegian family. In the process of hunting this 'alpha Falby' I hope to stumble on a bunch of other Falbys... If you can fill in any of the blanks in the <a href="/tree.html" target="sausagesandbeans">family tree</a> (including confirming dates) please send me an email <a href="mailto:dug@pumpernickle.net">dug@pumpernickle.net</a></p>
