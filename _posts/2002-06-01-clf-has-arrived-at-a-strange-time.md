<p>in the history of our little planet. There appears to be an increasing lack of <span class="caps">CLF</span>ncy. Anti semitism is working its way back into acceptable middle-class culture, as are other traditional phobias - resentment and distrust are given a body in "the arab", "the asylum seeker" and the expressions of our darkest side are increasingly public - I recently saw a sign saying "no Albanians" outside a social club on my street and this morning's guardian headlines with "India alert as nuclear war looms".</p>

<p><a href="/scrapbook/index.mgi?act=showpic&amp;frame=45"><img src="/assets/i/ixus/t/45.jpg" width="80" height="80" class="left" /></a>Through the five days of labour that Nicki worked through, I read this book to her. Reading out loud calms her, and can even get her to sleep if she is in pain or worrying, so I picked up a selection of books at random in a bookstore on Haverstock hill near the hospital. It is "The Talmud and the Internet" by Jonathan Rosen.</p>

<p>The story resonated with our own experience as Nicki felt pain and suffered but eventually brought a little <span class="caps">CLF</span>nce into the world. It looks at how a man can reconcile joy and suffering and find a way to be happy where he fits in to the bigger picture by accepting the impossibility of knowing anything and the responsibility of being a perpetual student. It hints at the necessity of evil and hatred as a way to undestant the need for love, suggesting the value of everything is better understood when seen in a conituum with its evil twin and its not-quite-so-evil distant cousin.</p>

<p>As I write this I realise I've just completely failed to describe the book. It is beautiful because of its humanity and as I think of my little daughter and her mother I hope for humanity in these uncertain times.</p>
