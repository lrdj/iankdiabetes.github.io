<p>Have recently experienced some really crazy shit and got thinking that most of it was due to a lack of empathy. Retweeting Russell's earlier vid reminded me of the little recording I did for a workshop on selling... The original idea belongs to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Sorkin">Aaron Sorkin</a> but I love it and I love his work and so I stole it.</p>

<p>It's amazing how much depends on empathy, and how little can be found in the corporate world. I reckon it's probably one of a manager's most misunderstood and powerful tools...</p>
