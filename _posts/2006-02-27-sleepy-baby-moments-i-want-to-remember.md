<p>Hi Hal, it's half-past twelve in the morning and you finished struggling with your insides about half an hour ago (looks v. sore, lots of grumbling and crying). You're almost three weeks old and are sleeping in your little chair on the dining room table. I'm doing some writing at the same table and giving your wee rocker a nudge whenever it looks like you're stirring...</p>

<p>Just wanted to write this down because the house is dark and quiet around us and I'm happy to be your dad:-)</p>
