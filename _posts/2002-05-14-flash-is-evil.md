<p>readers/05/remember several posts on the subject of Macromedia Flash's resistible rise.</p>

<p>While my personal design philosophy remains the same it has always been (as regards plug-ins) that the good ones are great and if used appropriately, are welcome.</p>

<p>For a funny and much less level headed assessment of the destruction of the internet by the legions of vile Flash-wielding wankers, read <a href="http://www.dack.com/web/flash_evil.html">dack.com</a></p>

<p>I've lifted this little pearl...</p>

<p><q>Maybe you have never seen e-commerce sites in flash, forms, chat rooms, but I can tell you they not only exist, but are in most cases superior, as they require less back end work from the server, thus making them more reliable</q></p>

<p>So less server involvement makes sites more reliable. I'm sorry, this isn't even funny...</p>
