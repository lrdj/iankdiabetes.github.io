<p><span class="caps">CLF </span>on tender-hooks yesterday as councils were due to send out emails at 17.30 with news of secondary school places. Just noting this down here for <span class="caps">CLF </span>(which was the original point of me writing all this stuff). In the end the thing she'll want to remember is the feeling she got when the email came through with her first choice school:-)</p>

<p>The gates above are made by the students and resident artists. All v. exciting, much to look forward to (they even have Arduinos in technology class! not like doing Rotring drawings of Le Creuset pans like I was doing at her age).</p>
