<p>Browsing the Apple website in search of support details and came across <a title="Riding with Robots on the High Frontier" href="http://homepage.mac.com/bdunford/robots/index.html">this</a></p>

<blockquote><p>A robot armada has been unleashed into the night sky. Its ships are unmanned interplanetary probes that fly faster than you will ever go, and cross distances you can't even imagine. But with nothing more than an Internet connection, you can go with them, catching sights that are as real—and as beautiful—as they are strange.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not only are the pictures wonderful, but there's <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/bdunford/robots/RidingWithRobots.wdgt.zip">a desktop widget</a></p>
