<p>Well, if we keep alienating our inalienable rights we could well be heading in that direction. This from a comment on Cory Doctorrow's excellent Boingboing post (gosh i haven't linkled to BB in aaaages) <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/03/21/london-imposes-defac.html">London imposes de-facto 9PM curfew on under-16s</a></p>

<blockquote><p>is there some way that the logical culmination of this can be headed off? Every indication in the press shows Britain heading for a summer of rage - and every action by the government seems calculated to incite this. It's obvious they want violence so they can have some killings and thereby justify even more heavy-handed repression. When will it be enough for them? Even now, someone is walking and breathing and slated for execution by police bullet or club in a few months time. This is like watching a slow motion car wreck and being helpless to stop the planned and inevitable. What kind of people can be party to this?</p></blockquote>
