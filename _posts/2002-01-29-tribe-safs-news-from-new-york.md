<p>Sabine and I were married the city of New York, in that funny building which you remember. Thursday,/01/24, at or about 1:00 <span class="caps">PM.</span> Danny and Juan Carlo as witnesses.</p>

<p>We had lunch at a Viet, next to where Pho Pasteur used to be. Followed by a cool banquet in a chinatown restaurant. All attendees were my close family and those of our tribe which still call the city home.</p>

<p>The definitive ceremony is still planned for Kln on/05/18th, invites to follow.</p>
