<p>But on a more personal, Donkey-esque note, one side-effect of trawling through your <em>pure-play digital</em> (actually saw this phrase today) life is coming across really old stuff that you'd forgotten ever doing.</p>

<p>This isn't going to mean a lot to non-webby or hci people, but I found an old concept I did for a UK diamond dealer called Celsteel. The big idea was this&#8212;as all around us were trying to figure out how to hide frame borders in all browsers (ah, those bad old days&#8230;) I presented a layout that was &#8216;tabbed' by having a nice thick frame border that was draggable cutting the page into a one-third / two-thirds grid. There were arrows and dotted lines (a bit like the arrows and tabs you have on a cut-out-and-assemble paper Lancaster bomber) on the background graphic which showed where to drag the divider to reveal the other page.</p>

<p>Anyway, the guy freaked and went with another designer. He's still in business and is currently modelling the <a href="http://www.celsteel.co.uk/">lens-flare 2004</a> look, so it's probably not a bad thing he sacked me:-)</p>
