<p>my friend Ben in Washington DC wants to know why there are no pictures in the scrapbook of the back wall of the back room. Well, that would be because the back wall is a horrible fright as Luis the carpenter's business associate has not delivered the closet units yet. Confused?</p>

<p><a href="/scrapbook/index.mgi?act=showpic&amp;frame=25"><img src="/assets/i/ixus/t/25.jpg" width="80" height="80" style="padding-right:1px;padding-bottom:1px;" align="left" /></a> This is a picture of the gas meter showing the rotten plaster and 30 years of water damage. This all gets walled off (ok, I can hear you tut, but until you've been exposed to long term British cowboy damage, you can keep stum...) so there is only sound wall visible. Note the new plaster door frame in the other pics :-)</p>
