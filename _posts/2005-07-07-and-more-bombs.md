<p>[Friday morning] Well, the front of the house is still there, so clearly the bomb on the bus was a false alarm. Still, no harm in being jumpy. I guess we'll be keeping an eye out for abandoned parcels in the tube again. I think once the <span class="caps">IRA </span>stopped blowing stuff up we Londoners may have gotten a little lax in that department...</p>

<p>[19:13] Arrive home in West Hampstead just as a rather young-looking Metropolitan Police officer is wrapping copious amounts of "police no entry" tape across my street, effectively barring entry to my house. I drive straight across the (very empty) road and into my front garden. Turns out there's a lone bus parked right across from my flat and the bus driver is being told to "keep walking quickly" down West End Lane.</p>

<p>It does seem very unlikely, but it looks like we might actually have a legitimate bomb-scare in our front yard.</p>

<p>(CLF is asleep out of range in the back room and Nicki and Dug are going to have a drink next door)</p>

<p>(although by some perverse arrangement of cat-like personality features, Nicki is insisting on looking out the front)</p>

<p>(more later...)</p>
