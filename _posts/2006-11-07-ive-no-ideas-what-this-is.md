<p>But the photo is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bozo/291440356/map/?view=everyones">geotagged</a> so if you follow the map to the store you can let me know what it's all about? </p>

<p>While you're there, scroll over to Battersea power station--the satellite photographs are amazing and there are almost 200 shots taken from in front of the building.</p>
