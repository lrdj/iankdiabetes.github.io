<p>we have now started discussing baby arrival in terms of "early". This is a problem seeing that our flat is still a mess. The bathroom is now going to happen in July and both the hall and the back room (baby room) are filled with rubble and dust.</p>

<p>I am going like gangbusters, but this stuff takes forever :-(</p>

<p>Keep your fingers crossed (as Nick keeps her legs crossed...)</p>
