<p>This from <a href="http://london-twitter.posterous.com/dysons-social-media-abortion-case-study-0">tweetie and the brain</a> an interesting look at how Dyson is speaking to customers with Twitter</p>

<blockquote><p>You have to be on form <span class="caps">ALL THE TIME </span>now. If you drop the ball <span class="caps">ONCE </span>the democratized voice of the internet can use it against you forever. But not playing is also not an option - your competitors are or will be using social channels to build an adoring customer base, spread their message, correct inaccuracies and have fun! (all hail @zappos).</p>

<p>Your only defence is sticking to strong core principles such as openness, honesty, civility and genuinely caring about your customers.</p></blockquote>

<p>That last comment really highlights why we need to finish up our brand work:-)</p>
