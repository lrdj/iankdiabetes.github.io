<p>Ahh looks like the old MT vs. Wordpress flame war may be <a href="http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html">heating up again</a>. Not a fan of the bitching and defo supportive of <a href="http://openmelody.org/">Project Melody</a> initiator <a href="http://majordojo.com/">Byrne Reese's</a> attitude that the Melody crew needs to keep to a positive message and stay away from the flame wars...</p>

<p>That said, I love some of the copy...</p>

<blockquote><p>This does not surprise me at all. Wordpress is an absolute triumph of flair and marketing over engineering. It's pretty, featuresome and buggier than a swamp.</p></blockquote>
