<p>I've been thinking quite a bit about colours since before Christmas and have been trying to build a couple of colourways. In the process I've been playing with swatch books and boy, the whole pantone colour system has continued to grow in size and complexity since I first started designing stuff (hey Daniel, you remember buying sheets of stickyback Pantone color to make comps with?). Now you can even <a href="http://www.roumazeilles.net/news/fr/wordpress/2007/12/24/tasses-a-cafe-pantone/">get an expresso set</a>. </p>

<p>Not exactly the colour scheme I was looking for but with my birthday in late January a treat may be in order:-)</p>
