<p>So when I first started being interested in markup, I used to spend a lot of time trying to get non Western characters to work in web pages and imagining all sorts of crazy systems to support the transparent publishing across many weird and wonderful languages with their equally unique fonts.</p>

<p>Then unicode support became routine and I guess I stopped being so amazed when it worked;-) So the state of play is both wonderful and a little crap: I can now be spammed in Kanji, Cyrillic or even English if the lottery folk think that's what I'm most likely to read...</p>
