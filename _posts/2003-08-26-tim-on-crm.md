<p>Interesting thought by Tim over at <a href="http://www.stealthisbrand.blogspot.com/2003_08_01_stealthisbrand_archive.html#106162630144671937">stealthisbrand</a>. He ponders what would happen if corporates were subject to the same restrictions as governments in dealing with their customers (CRM--discrimination by another name?).</p>

<p>Which kinda got me thinking, in the years since companies started spending large amounts of money on <span class="caps">CRM </span>products (my finger - in - the - air estimate reckons it started getting harder to get a human response or indeed any response to a customer service query about ten to fifteen years ago), quality of service to the end-user has consistently gotten worse.</p>

<p>Now seeing as this hasn't resulted in said companies going out of business due to loss of customers, and seeing as I'm not getting good service from anyone, this must mean I am being discriminated against--I must be a bad customer, the 20 to the 80, a time waster, a troublemaker.</p>

<p>Right, so time to burn my bra and chop up my Tesco ClubCard--or better still, time to ask Tesco for a transcript of all the data they hold on me under the data protection act;-)</p>
