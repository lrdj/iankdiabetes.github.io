<p>I was doing some research on social software and have just come across Christopher Allen's blog, <a title="Life With Alacrity" href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/">Life With Alacrity</a>, and mention of his application <a title="Life With Alacrity: SynchroEdit: Simultaneous Editing for the Web" href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/10/for_the_last_se.html">SynchroEdit</a>.</p>

<p>I've been trying to experiment with SubEthaEdit which is a very cool (I'm told) app for simultaneous realtime modification of a web page. Sounds very great, but couldn't find anyone else with it installed (it's a Mac <span class="caps">OSX </span>app) so haven't been able to have much of a play.</p>

<p>In any case, Synchro is web-based so should be easier to experiment with :-)</p>
