<p>But still no computer :-(</p>

<p>Albion on Mortimer Street have had the damn powerbook two weeks and they can't mend the <span class="caps">DVD </span>drive. Unbelievable, in the end I decided to just go and fetch the machine and forget about having a cd drive (grrrr) they reckon I need to zero the drive and reinstall <span class="caps">OSX </span>why it took them two weeks to work this out...</p>

<p>Note to self: ask questions about inability to function without own computer...</p>

<p>On the plus side, Ben is coming over from Washington DC in two weeks time and we are heading out to Wales for an off-road bike week-end. Am counting the minutes.</p>
