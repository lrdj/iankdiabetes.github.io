<p>Mike Butcher points out that new European legislation will <a title="It's all over for the astroturfers | Mike Butcher - mbites" href="http://mbites.com/2007/06/20/its_all_over_for_the_astroturfers">make astroturfing illegal</a>.</p>

<p>Which of course is a good thing, but how are they going to enforce this? The higher end PR firms are creating great thinking about their clients by <em>actually participating</em> in the debate or even initiating it themselves.</p>

<p>I guess the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Burgess">Barry Scott</a> test is going to become this law's Turing test;-)</p>
