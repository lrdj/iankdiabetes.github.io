<p>More activity on the old <a title="Is BT still shit? (A Donkey on the Edge)" href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/family/is_bt_still_shit.html">Is BT still shit?</a> post. A chap called Carlos has left <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/family/is_bt_still_shit.html#comment-22413">a comment about his experience</a> with BT and it sounds pretty spectacular...</p>

<p>Please keep your feedback coming in and if you find any ways around the system (such as that 'secret' phone number posted on the first "BT is shit" post) please do share them.</p>
