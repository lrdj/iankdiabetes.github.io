<p>I was catching up with my newspaper reading this evening, when I came across <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,805511,00.html">a story</a> which describes in coherent terms what I was talking about in the <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/permalinker/?pid=7007&amp;blog=donkey">earlier post</a> re Baader-Meinhof, Carlos et al.</p>

<p>I love the comments about young'uns wearing crush velvet flares and Ray-Bans &agrave; la Andreas Baader</p>

<p><q> ...an extraordinary revival in Germany of 'Terror Chic'. The catwalks are full of the crushed velvet flares and Ray-Bans favoured by Baader, the red <span class="caps">RAF </span>star adorns T-shirts, and one fashion designer has even adopted the provocative slogan 'Prada-Meinhof' </q></p>
