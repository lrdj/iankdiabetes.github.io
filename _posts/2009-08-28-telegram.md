<p>Listening to my Gainsbourg playlist and was reminded of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKt02F371s4">Overseas Telegram</a> and got to wondering</p>

<ul>
<li>can you still send a telegram? </li>
<li>Where would you sent it from, a post office?</li>
<li>And if you can't anymore, did anyone make a formal announcement of its demise?</li>
</ul>

<p>and so I guess I haven't been to a wedding in a while, when was the last time you heard someone read out telegrams from absent friends...</p>
