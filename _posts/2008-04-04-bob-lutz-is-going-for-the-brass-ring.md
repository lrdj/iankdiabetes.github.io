<p>Wow, you know, I don't normally read Bob Lutz's stuff over at the <a title="Detroit Auto News - Auto Industry News from the GM FastLane Blog and Bob Lutz" href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/">GM FastLane Blog</a> which is odd because I quote the blog to clients all the time. Just took a peek today and saw this:</p>

<blockquote>
... In the end, it cost us much more than that; it cost us our reputation for technology leadership and innovation.

<p>We made that mistake once. We wonâ€™t make it again. I think the whole company has learned when you step out and do bold things, you win and when you're cautious and let other people do the bold things, you lose.</p>

Many great ideas die every day because we value the safety of the tried-and-true over the risk that true innovation requires. This is not going to be the case with Volt; we are going for the brass ring.<br />
</blockquote>

<p>Great stuff, a senior VP publicly admitting he fucked up (and promising not to trip over the same log twice).</p>

<p>So this volt thing seems pretty cool. It's a different strategy than the Tesla plan. The board at <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">Tesla Motors</a> are banking on a high-performance car (the 2008 <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/design/gallery-body.php">Tesla Roadster</a>) to get the ev ball rolling and they plan to roll out an inexpensive family saloon after that.</p>

<p>Also, the Volt is an <a href="http://gm-volt.com/about/">E-REV</a> so still factoring in the petrol pump...</p>
