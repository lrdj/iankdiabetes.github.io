<p>Ruth, my mother, reads this log and has sent in corrections about the previous post. I have edited the post the get the facts straight (thanks Ruth). I'm trying to get her to keep her own web log as I know so little of her pre-married life, and I'm sure my children would like to read about it too at some point in their lives. </p>

<p>Will continue suggesting...</p>
