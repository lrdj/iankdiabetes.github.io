<p>Not like us cheeky biker-types who are familiar with little two-stroke Yam's and their ilk (tho now that I've aged and drive a lumpen opposed twin, my serious revving days are behind me)...</p>

<p>Diego Rodriguez has posted an astonishing little film about revs in <a title="metacool: Unabashed Gearhead Gnarlyness" href="http://metacool.typepad.com/metacool/2006/02/unabashed_gearh.html#comments">metacool: Unabashed Gearhead Gnarlyness</a> and if you're looking for a pick-me-up you could do worse than listen in (it's a F1-Cosworth <span class="caps">V10 </span>doing a computer-controlled start-up sequence apparently).</p>
