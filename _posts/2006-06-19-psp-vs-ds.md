<p>There appears to be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYnqCm0uE4&amp;search=psp">some debate</a> about the relative superiority of the Nintendo DS and Sony's <span class="caps">PSP.</span> Unusually for this kind of online debate, the quality of the language is very high.</p>

<blockquote><p>shutup timD just cuz u cant afford a psp u can suck my balls</p>

<p><strong>you fucking nintendo whores. clearly. you wanna talk originallity? supermario bros = supermario bros ds. repeated kirby games, there all the same!! i dont see the difference, besides that the ds only does games. psp does video, mp3, wireless internet, photos, and <span class="caps">VIDEO GAMES THAT ROCK</span>! i do indeed plan on buying a ds, because the new super mario bros. intrigues me. psp = pc based handheld. ds = two game boys brought together with a "stick" to touch itself with.</strong></p>

<p>dude shutt the fuck up or ill take that stylus and stick it up your uretheral sideways!! (if youd dont know what that word is ^ its your penis whole...jackass)</p>

<p><strong>i bet youve never even played either one</strong></p>

<p>thank you person with actuall friggin' brains!!</p>

<p><strong>...watch me bitch</strong></p>

<p><span class="caps">PSP </span>is better then ds...Accept it. The only thing ds has over psp is games and how the F*** is games better then video,Music and photos combined.</p></blockquote>

<p>[etc]</p>

<p>I can't say I had ever heard a stylus described as something to touch oneself with;-)</p>
