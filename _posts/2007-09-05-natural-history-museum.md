<p>I love this photograph for the <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/">Natural History Museum</a> kids only sections (sorry about the image quality, snapped on a bus stop). </p>

<p>The portrait had to have been done in a massive black poly tunnel and considering the background is exposed to a stop more light than the foreground the dynamic range of the shot is astonishing. Information exists in the darkest shadows and none of the white fabric definition is lost on the sides of the hood (which are white on white after all). They should use this shot in lighting school.</p>

<p>Oh, and the art direction is lovely too;-)</p>
