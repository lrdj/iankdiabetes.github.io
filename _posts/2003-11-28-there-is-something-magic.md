<p>About finally finding a bug and sending it off to the place from whence <em>non puede salir</em>.</p>

<p>In this case, the animal was a call to Javascript's .length method, a harmless little tool for extracting the length of a variable (dug = 3 or donkey = 6) such a small thing, but the incorrect value returned was being disguised by a much more complex and much guiltier-looking function that was doing unspeakable things with cookies.</p>

<p>Anyway, two weeks and 437 alert() calls later, I finally found it.</p>

<p>I feel lighter, younger, richer, more beautiful and overall more Zen about this project now :-)</p>
