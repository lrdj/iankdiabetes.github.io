<p>So doesn't anybody else think this <a title="MS Exchange Blog : Daylight Savings Time (DST) Tool Update" href="http://hellomate.typepad.com/exchange/2007/02/daylight_saving.html">daylight savings time (DST)</a> thing is a bit odd. I mean I'm probably getting the wrong end of the stick but are people having to apply patches (to their computers)? Because of daylight savings time? In 2007?</p>

<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>no more question marks but I can't help digging around for my smug hat, this is just daft...</p>
