<p>It sort of amazes me that with all the fanfare around <span class="caps">CLF'</span>s birth (readers may rememember the blow-by-blow of her mother's labour)--and the fact that this blog was initially set up to track the goings on in my head about becoming a dad--that I haven't felt it necessary to mention Nick and I are going to have a son.</p>

<p>That's one baby boy due 2 Feb 2006 if all goes well.</p>

<p>Between now and then, we need to move house and get <span class="caps">CLF </span>into a school for next year (So no pressure then)...</p>
