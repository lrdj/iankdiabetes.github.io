<p>So I participated in a Katrina relief charity initiative a few months ago and had largely forgotten about it when what should pop through the letterbox but an enveloppe from <a href="http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/">Verve</a> stuffed full of lovely jazz cds.</p>

<p>Am currently listening to <a href="http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/product.aspx?ob=n&amp;src=art&amp;pid=11372">new grass</a> a recording made in New York in 1968 and it's mad and insane:-)</p>
