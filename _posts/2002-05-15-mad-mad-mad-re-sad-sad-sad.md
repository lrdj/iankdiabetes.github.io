<p>Billy says: hello? You're about to have a kid? And you've just got yourself some groovy speakers? I'm sorry. There's something about this that just doesn't add up. Next thing you'll be telling me you're going to jump on a motorbike and ride to Dakar...</p>

<p>Dug says: well dear, that was the plan ;-) But seriously, I couldn't have afforded to replace my speakers myself (particularly since I had just shelled out a pretty penny to have them mended) but luckily, they were covered by my contents insurance.</p>

<p>Speaking of speakers, my next CD curiosity is Decca 414 383-2 this was recorded from the studio monitor during a major recording - capturing the composer's voice (one half of a sometimes surreal conversation) without his knowledge. While he condemned this at the time, it would have been a shame to keep it under wraps...</p>
