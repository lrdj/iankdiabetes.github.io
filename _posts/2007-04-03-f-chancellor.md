<p>Really loving my new employer. I just had to pay for a <span class="caps">CHAPS </span>transfer to ensure that I get paid on my payday. On top of that I have to pay <span class="caps">GBP100</span>/month to get paid at all.</p>

<p>Of course I shouldn't be taking it out on Gordon Brown seeing as he's just defaulted on his promise to help the UKs poorest children and is no doubt still trying to find a way to finance the <span class="caps">UK'</span>s <a href="http://www.medialens.org/alerts/06/061128_war_and_peace.php">defence budget hike</a> to <span class="caps">GBP33.6 </span>billion for 2006-07. Quite a tough bit of accounting.</p>

<p>Still, I guess I'm being stung by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR35"><span class="caps">IR35</span></a> which after all was one of the seeds planted under Thatcher (I seem to remember in a kind of distant, non-accurate sort of hazy way...)</p>
