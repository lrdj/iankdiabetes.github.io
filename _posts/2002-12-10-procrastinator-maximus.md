<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>one more post and then back to work...</p>

<p>Yesterday, <span class="caps">CLF </span>started forming the bababa syllables for the first time. Nick and I were getting a tiny bit concerned as <span class="caps">CLF </span>wasn't saying much and at six and a half months, wee'uns are supposed to be babbling.</p>

<p>So now she sits there, looks straight a me with purpose and starts "blaublaublaublau..." kinda like she's saying "blue" in german. In any case, another growth milestone reached:-)</p>
