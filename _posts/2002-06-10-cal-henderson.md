<p>Been visiting the <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/misc/fonts/">iamcal network</a> a lot ever since <a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/">Billy</a> decided to download Cal's metalinker script. Sites like these cheer me up big time.</p>

<p>Also, Cal has been responding to calls for help re debugging the osx version of his script. Way to go Cal :-)</p>
