So in the recent flurry of template and CMS tests, tweaks and plays (going from MT3 stable with the kiss82 template through mayhem and currently running the unstable Motion beta of MT4.25 since you asked...) I grabbed this favicon of a donkey. I popped it into the home directory and figured I'd have a play and then decide whether or not to use it and managed to misplace the URI of where I got it in the first place.

If this is your work I'd really like to credit you. Send me a ping if the animal is yours;-)
