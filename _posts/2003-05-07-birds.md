<p>Well, it's about twenty to five in morning and I've been working all night:-(</p>

<p>On the plus side, I can now hear birdsong outside my window--the combination of sleepless night, birdsong and that particularly lovely smell of summer you get in the city combine to make me feel like a student on a hot new York summer night in 1985 when I've spent the whole night slumming around cbgb or the mud club and have come uptown in time for breakfast...</p>
