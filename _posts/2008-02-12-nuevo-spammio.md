<p>Well well well, a new kind of phishing has landed in my inbox. Just when I thought the relatives and colleagues of intestate central african millionaires could show no further bounty, I am now being showered with cash by those friendly folk at the <span class="caps">IRS </span>;-)</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</strong><br />
United States Department of the Treasury<br />
After the last annual calculations of your fiscal activity we have determined that you are eligible to receive a tax refund of $184.80.<br />
Please submit the tax refund request and allow us 6-9 days in order to process it.</p></blockquote>

<p>A pretty lo-fi attempt with no decent url spoofing or fancy html, not even a serious-looking <span class="caps">IRS </span>logo. Still, as a new take on an old trick it may hook a few incredulous pennies...</p>
