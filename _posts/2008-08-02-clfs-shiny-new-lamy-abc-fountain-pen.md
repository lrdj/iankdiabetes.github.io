<p><span class="caps">CLF </span>has been learning to write these past few years and I was buying stamps at a stationners in Farnham when I came across this pen. I first heard it mentioned by <a href="http://www.richardspens.com/">Richard Binder</a> and since then have thought it would make a great addition for <span class="caps">CLF.</span> She's visiting her Nan right now but I'll present it when she gets back (with "CLF" on the cap, not "Thomas" of course).</p>

<p>It's slightly tricky, Jed--my dad--is a talented calligrapher and I can manage some fluid strokes myself when I need to. The temptation is to try and get <span class="caps">CLF </span>writing like I was taught in school (in France we were taught 'joined-up' writing from the get-go using the the redoutable "Stypen" best known for leaving puddles of ink everywhere) but that's exactly what my dad tried to do and it got me in a bit of muddle on the handwriting front...</p>

<p>So I'm going to bite my lip for now and help her with her non-cursive letterforms:-)</p>
