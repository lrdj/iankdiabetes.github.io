<p>I've walked past this mannequin (is that the word?) for a week know and stop and stare every time I go in to buy a sandwich. I'm guessing this particular model is based on Kate Moss, but the hair-style, the lighting and position make her a doppelg√§nger for <a href="http://www.celebrity-babies.com/2006/09/is_meg_white_ex.html">Meg White</a> :-)</p>
