<p>And I just unlocked my Nokia 6600 so now I can use the Orange <span class="caps">SIM </span>in it:-)</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://instantunlocking.co.uk/">this service</a> and it went reasonably smoothly. Haven't seen my phone bill yet--it ain't free--but I'm hoping it won't be too much over a fiver...</p>
