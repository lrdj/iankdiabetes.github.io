<p>I just wanted to say thanks to Gavin at <a title="Mac Upgrades - Macintosh Upgrades in the UK" href="http://www.macupgrades.co.uk/store/">Mac Upgrades</a> for a really great job.</p>

<p>If you've got a Mac that isn't old enough to give to the kids but is starting to act up you could do a lot worse than give these chaps a call. They will upgrade just about anything with anything and they keep a large stock of second-hand parts which could save you an expensive trip to Cuppertino.</p>

<p>They've just mended a powermac, upgraded my production powerbook and replaced the monitor strip in Nick's iBook. The work was done quickly and the price is very reasonable, I can't recommend them highly enough:-)</p>

<p>Finally, I you do head up there with a bootful of old kit, can I suggest the cooked breakfast at the <a href="http://www.comfortcafe.co.uk/">World Famous Comfort Caf√©</a> Fourwentways, Little Abington, Cambridge, <span class="caps">CB1</span> 6AP (tel 01223 837 891)</p>
