<p>Thank you <a href="http://pombostrans.blogspot.com/">enigmatic mermaid</a> for pointing me at the <a href="http://www.aria-database.com/">aria database</a> &mdash; perhaps not the net's most useful resource, but fun, and v. cool :-) Try <a href="http://www.aria-database.com/libretti/manon09_sola.txt">this text file</a> for the aria that's been eating me up most recently. Which reminds me, must go shopping for more...</p>
