<p><q> Raging Cow Hits the Shelves in Select Markets <br /> Cheered by a rowdy mascot, Dr Pepper/Seven Up executives announced the rollout of Raging Cow new milk-based product served cold in single servings, with an array of five alluring flavors. Packaged in plastic bottles, Raging Cow will hit store shelves in select markets, eventually expanding to national distribution. </q></p>
