<p>Clearly old <a href="http://chris.carline.org/">Chrimble</a> has too much time on his hands. His power rating in <a href="http://www.paranormaldeathmatch.co.uk">paranormal deathmatch</a> (<em>and</em> he could afford the magic wardrobe) would indicate that the man has fought 4,761 opponents, taking an average of two minutes per fight, that's 9,533 minutes of fighting, or 158 hours (the equivalent of twenty (20!) workdays) of metaphysical bloodshed ;-)</p>
