<p>A colleague just pointed me to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCeUBZQKkfg">this video</a> which a friend of his (Bjorn Turmann) posted to YouTube to promote the launch of <a href="http://www.cortoushaire.com/">his new book</a></p>

<p>I think the film is a little understated so may not do tremendously well on YouTube which does tend to feature the more explosive videos.</p>

<p>Still, it's a very interesting experiment in getting messages out across media. It reminds me of the James Bond book launch I worked on a few years ago were the story ended, and on the last page, we put a message from a sinister security organisation asking for recruits. The message had a url which led to some recruitment tests which in turn led to an adventure game where the reader had to work with other readers to save a beautiful (of course) scientist from the grips of an evil overlord.</p>
