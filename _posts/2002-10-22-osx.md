<p>So I'm sitting at a table at the Welcome Break just up the M1 working on the actionscript Andy sent me last night and I go to paste it back into his file when tarnations, I realise I've only pulled the .swf off the server before leaving.</p>

<p>No probs, I whack the ericsson gprs on the table, turn on irda, connecting... woohoo, we're online. So, I go "connect to server", mount the main Pumpernickle job bag server and I'm away.</p>

<p>Except that Andy's file is about a million levels deep and for each re-draw of the Finder window, the server is trying to pump full-size Appleshare data (you know, pretty icons etc) through the micromini irda port. Double-click, wait and wait. Double click, wait and wait...</p>

<p>And then my brain actually wakes up&mdash;I don't need the finder at all. I remember that my <span class="caps">OSX </span>powerbook has a command line and start typing. One cp /Volumes/HD22/Sharepoints/job_bags/Andy_development/Andytest.fla wip/ and voil&agrave; one lovely .fla file ready to go:-)</p>

<p>As much as I hate Steve Jobs for making me pay over and over for the same product and for his overall shitty attitude to older customers (read all about bronze <span class="caps">DVD </span>problems later) I must admit Unix powerbooks are a very, very good thing:-)</p>
