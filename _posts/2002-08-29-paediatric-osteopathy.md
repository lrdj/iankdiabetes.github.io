<p>Nick and I took <span class="caps">CLF </span>to <a href="http://www.occ.uk.com/">The Osteopathic Centre for Children</a> this afternoon. There's nothing wrong with her, it's just that as she was ventouse (French for suction-cup&mdash;sez it all) delivered, the word on the street says you should get her skull looked at. </p>

<p>She was treated by a couple of really good people and I think she quite enjoyed it... The whole operation is fantastic &mdash; old Dianna arranged for the Centre (which is a charity) to get this building and they've converted the entire house (that';s an entire house on Harley Street) into a wonderful child-friendly space. The receptionist sits in a tree house, the walls are all different colours and the treatment rooms are huge open spaces with tables made out of giant slabs of oak.</p>

<p>The whole experience made me want to be the one getting treatment:-)</p>
