<p>arse. <a href="http://www.paranormaldeathmatch.co.uk/">deathmatch</a> has been hacked. As much as I like the idea of a secure internet with no open relays and exploit-resistant boxes those silly hackers (you know the ones, the ones that shouldn't be calling themselves hackers in the first place coz hacking has nothing to do with messing with people's stuff and use that really annoying <span class="caps">STU</span>pidZ4U upper-and-lower HkkkerZZ typography <strong>grrr</strong>) shouldn't do the <a href="/i/para_dm_hack.gif">own</a> thing.</p>

<p>Particularly if they did a rm -R as root thereby deleting everything (including my little alien avatar I had wasted hours getting to level 600 <strong>more grrr</strong>).</p>

<p>Bastards.</p>
