<p>Don't miss OK/Cancel's fabulous new 're-experiencing' of <a href="http://www.ok-cancel.com">their site</a> :-)</p>

<blockquote><p>When we completed our initial brainstorming, we continued onto the <span class="caps">IA.</span> Here, we recruited Thomas Vander Wal, credited for inventing the term â€œfolksonomyâ€? to help us create a new navigation structure. The result is a nav structure that was based off of the most common tags used to describe items. </p>

<p>Thus, â€œHomeâ€? became â€œMeâ€?, â€œAboutâ€? became â€œThatâ€?, â€œArchivesâ€? became â€œ2005", â€œFeaturesâ€? became â€œThingieâ€?, â€œStoreâ€? became â€œOrangeâ€?, â€œResourcesâ€? became â€œResorcesâ€? and of course, â€œJobsâ€? became â€œMoneyâ€?.</p>

<p>However, before we implemented this, we got a second opinion from Peter Merholz, who thinks weâ€™re simply wasting our time creating any user experience at all and that we might as well just go and die. </p>

<p>Or perhaps we misunderstood.</p></blockquote>
