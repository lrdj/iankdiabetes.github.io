<p>Wow this is so cool my friend Morten in Norway has started designing and manufacturing a portable light-source capable of sampling the colour of ambient light and projecting a constant or strobe source with a temperature range well in excess of the traditional <span class="caps">CTO </span>to <span class="caps">CTB </span>range.</p>

<p>And the coolest part is the whole project is open. If you don't want to buy it from him, you can download the <span class="caps">CAD </span>details and schematics and get your friend in China to build it for you instead.</p>

<p>I quite fancy having a go in the garage tho... <a href="http://riftlabs.com/get-involved/">Read all about it</a></p>
