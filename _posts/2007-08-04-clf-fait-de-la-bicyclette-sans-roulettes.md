<p>Well, I didn't have the camera with me but this morning we put the pedals on the bicycle and <span class="caps">CLF </span>pedaled away. She can ride a bike, yay!</p>

<p>It's great, actually, because I've been feeling a bit like I've been letting the side down in the parenting department. All the travel to France and the doing second projects on weekends means I haven't been able to spend as much time with <span class="caps">CLF </span>and Hal as I'd like to. So knowing she can swim a length of the pool no problem and ride a bike makes me feel a bit like I've helped some:-)</p>

<p><i><span class="caps">CLF, </span>il s'est pass√© quelque chose d'abominable aujourd'hui. Je te l'indique ici pour quand tu reliras ces pages, tu t'en souviendras peut etre...</i></p>
