<blockquote><p>I've been working on my own type of <span class="caps">CSS </span>framework lately. When Shaun Inman released the update to the Server-Side <span class="caps">CSS</span> Processor last year, I jumped on the bandwagon and made a layout plugin for it, which then turned into a Coda Plugin. After toying with each of these methods, I decided that <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/archive/2008/05/30/check_out_css_cacheer">Cacheer</a> was the way to go. (see the <a href="http://anthonyshort.com.au/blog/comments/video-an-introduction-to-csscaffold/">video</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>This is like Textile for <span class="caps">HTML...</span> I love the way the shortcuts assume knowledge of <span class="caps">CSS.</span> In other words, the framework isn't a substitute for proper <span class="caps">CSS </span>knowledge but rather a set of useful shortcuts for someone who understands what's going on in the background. Will defo need to get hands on beta...</p>
