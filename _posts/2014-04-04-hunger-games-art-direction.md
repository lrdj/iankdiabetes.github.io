<p>It's a still life that lasts a couple of seconds and is part of a painful but beautiful scene-setting: soot-coated men walking back from the mines; children barefoot and dirty playing in the wasteland; an old toothless man fighting chicken bones are all images that describe the poverty and suffering of "District 12", the lead's homeland.</p>

<p>I remember thinking how wonderful this scene-setting was as it referenced historical touch-points that resonate.</p>

<p>This particular portrait made me think of <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/list/128_migm.html">Dorothea Lange's "Migrant Mother" photographs</a> taken for the Farm Security Administration in February 1936. I never actually compared the two at the time but after seeing Catching Fire I went back and compared the images. I just love the effort that went into getting that just right:-)</p>

<p>Powerful stuff, and the anger one feels at poverty and injustice is made all the more tangible by the art direction.</p>
