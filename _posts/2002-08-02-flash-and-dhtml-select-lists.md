<p>Had a little chat with Eddie Traversa over at <a href="http://dhtmlnirvana.com/">dhtmlnirvana.com</a> this morning and we got to talking about how some nice dom manipulation can give you Flash-like effects without the plugin. Or, in other words, how many people even notice the dhtml cross fading on <a href="http://www.pumpernickle.net/">pumpernickle.net</a> I think most folks either just experience it without noticing it or assume it's a Flash effect...</p>

<p>Right about the same time, <a href="http://www.purplemanchester.co.uk/">Andy</a> sent me an email asking if the dom could be manipulated to render the "open" state of a select list. I said no, as the browser uses the os's widget library to draw it but he could probably hack something in dhtml. So I got curious and have just spent the last hour playing with a <a href="http://www.pumpernickle.net/andy_dev/select.html">formatted html definition list </a></p>

<p>Why in the world would you want to complicate a page like this when the plain vanilla select statement does the job? Answers on a post-card &mdash; still, it looks nice (and works well in Lynx, of course)...</p>
