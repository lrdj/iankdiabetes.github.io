<p>If you get an email with a subject something like "[New Challenges] Soandso has Tagged you! :)" delete it quickly. I can't say for sure whether the company (tagged.com) is the next generation of sploggers or spammers gone social or if what happened to me this morning was just a cock-up on my part.</p>

<p>So I got the email this morning. As I follow Web2.0 stuff as part of my job I tend to register for everything to see what's what...</p>

<ol>
<li>I follow the link in the email</li>
<li>I register on the site</li>
<li>Noticing they're using the gmail api to pull addresses I think "cool" and give it a try</li>
<li>On the address listing I mark one of my demo emails as a friend and click on "invite"</li>
</ol>

<p>...at which point everyone in my gmail address book receives a "you've been tagged" email. This is great, I of course relish the chance to be incredibly rude to friends and strangers alike while looking completely stupid at the same time.</p>

<p>As Tim said in his angry response "Dug, this is a terrible service". Tim, I couldn't agree more.</p>

<p>And finally, dear gmail address book folk, sorry about my invading your inbox this morning:-(</p>
