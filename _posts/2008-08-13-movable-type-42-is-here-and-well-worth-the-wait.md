<p>Wow, I thought I'd be playing with <span class="caps">RC5 </span>for a while before getting the final release but no, the real thing is here. Go <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/2008/08/movable_type_42_is_here.html">grab yourself a copy</a> </p>

<p>With the long list of recent launch disappointments (with iPhone 3G by far the smelliest) I gotta say, Six Apart have not only delivered a hugely improved product (faster, more features) but a whole new license structure. </p>

<p>The new licenses are very much value co-creation engines. In a nutshell, let the mass of small businesses and bloggers use all the variations and toys for free, let them build on them, change them, and if they manage to scrape some revenue out of their enterprise, then ask them to buy services (primarily the excellent support) and pay for a commercial license.</p>

<p>I am very, very impressed and will be upgrading all my installations immediately. Great work 6A:-)</p>
