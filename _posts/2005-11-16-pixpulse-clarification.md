<p>David wrote in this morning. He is concerned that the debate is missing his central premise. Here's his note:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey Dug -</p>

<p>Saw your blog post.  I just wanted to introduce myself and also give a response.  I think quite a few people are missing the point here.  PixPulse is not a photo storing site, I don't want people to upload their 100 photos from their last Disneyland trip, I do want people to share daily life experiences on PixPulse and publish their media with friends and the public.</p>

<p>My real point here is that very few phones use the Symbian <span class="caps">OS. </span> You can't build a business model on a OS that is only supported by less than 5% of the world's handset population.  Building a <span class="caps">J2ME </span>app on every mobile phone and doing carrier testing is not feasible.  <span class="caps">SMS </span>and <span class="caps">MMS </span>via email is easy and practially supported by all carriers.</p>

<p>I like Shozu, but Shozu is not PixPulse.  Looks like both you and Roland have talked me into building an <span class="caps">API </span>for Shozu ;)  Would enjoy feed back from you.</p>

<p>-- <br />
Cheers,</p>

<p>He makes a good point about the ubiquity of email across networks and the difficulty of creating a tested, reliable user base of <span class="caps">J2ME </span>clients across many handsets. I like his offer of an <span class="caps">API </span>(always interesting). In the case of <a href="http://www.shozu.com/">ShoZu</a>, I think the functionality and user experience are so good that serious Flickreens may well be tempted to upgrade to a Symbian handset fro this service alone.</p>

<p>Time will tell:-)</p>
