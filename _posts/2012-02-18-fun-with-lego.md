<p>Hal keeps getting given these Lego sets. Most recently, he's had a Pirates of the Caribbean thing with a mill-wheel and a bell tower (set <a href="http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=4183-1">4183-1</a>) and before that it was Mandalorian fighters (set <a href="http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7914-1">7914-1</a>) and the Space Shuttle (set <a href="http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=3367-1">3367-1</a>) as well as a bunch of others I can't locate. </p>

<p>I pretty much build these as Hal wants the finished product in a hurry but what tends to happen is that he goes for it and pretty soon the toy breaks. Of course it's Lego, so it's not <em>breaking</em> as such, it's supposed to come apart after all...</p>

<p>Recently, after spending a good hour assembling the pirates set I decided that the thing to do would be to glue the parts with super-glue. Not the whole assembly, but those groups of parts that moved or were hinged in some way (the Shuttle's bay doors only stayed attached to the mother ship for a few minutes under heavy playing). </p>

<p>So, I read up on the Lego forums to find out what the best glue was and did anyone have any techniques for glueing with a light touch to prevent destroying the bricks. I can't imagine I'm the only dad out there who has had this idea so I was really surprised to read the <a href="http://messageboards.lego.com/en-US/showpost.aspx?PostID=1000440077">near universal condemnation</a> of glue in Lego assembly...</p>

<p>So in the end I gave up on the glue and this morning I was playing with Hal and we smashed up the Space Shuttle and I put this F-22 Raptor together. <span class="caps">OK, </span>so it looks nothing like a raptor and it's missing its nose cone among other things but it was really fun to do.</p>

<p>I just never tire of the way a couple of bricks can suggest a familiar profile, a familiar shape:-)</p>

<p>The other kind of interesting thing was that in trying to get the two jet engines as close as possible, I made the main body lift area (the bit between the two turbines) with an odd number of rows. Normally my models are symmetrical but in this instance I had to have a central, single-row brick running down the middle. For some reason this made progress way more difficult. The cockpit glass comes from a dinosaur set and was four rows wide so to fit the nose cone (or make a gap where the nose-cone would go) I had to use flat pieces with uneven numbers of rows on top and bottom (I think they were claws from another animal, with two rows on the bottom but a single, centred row on the top)</p>

<p>So yeah, so do you glue your Lego?</p>
