<p>Funny taking her back to the hospital where she was born, kind of a return to the womb (that word should so totally have two 'o's)... She was there with Nick from 15:00 to 23:30 yesterday. When I got there Nick was shattered, but today being my childcare day I got to have quality time with doctors.</p>

<p>To cut a long story short she's fine. We've been given antibiotics, she's eating well and apart from looking like she hasn't slept in a fortnight, she's on the mend.</p>
