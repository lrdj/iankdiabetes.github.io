<p><em>Really?</em></p>

<p>Wow, this is kinda odd. I mean it's November 2007 and this article is writen as if this is news.</p>

<blockquote><p>Online shoppers are not taken in by online advertising, and are turning to customer reviews, forums and blogs to help shape their decisions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Equally, no mention of the pros and cons of review aggregation and reselling nor any mention of the likes of <a href="http://www.reevoo.com/">reevoo</a> -- Still, nice to have the percentages (66% does seem low but hey...)</p>
