<p>So I was happily listening to a worthy program on Inter on the way through France the day before yesterday and was surprised to hear the following comment:</p>

<p><q> I wouldn't throw Anne Frank's diary in the Seine--it's illegal to chuck garbage in the river </q></p>

<p>Now, I personally think that giving racists, bigots, maniacs and idiots the same airtime as left-of-centre moderates is important to guarantee a number of our key freedoms, but this stuck in my throat.</p>

<p>The program was a classic <span class="caps">NPR,</span> Radio 4 type human-interest piece about the 'bouquinistes'--the people who man those quirky little bookstalls along the banks of the Seine. We had just heard the story of a woman who had done this for twenty-odd years, working her way up from a miserable plot right at the end of the 'quais' where business was tough, eventually landing herself a prime spot in front of Notre-Dame. It's a good story: hard work, early mornings trawling the 'puces' in search of rare finds to fill her stalls and many tales of the eccentrics that make the work interesting.</p>

<p>And then, in the middle of all this mister let's - put - the - jews - back - on - the - trains rears his ugly head. I'm shocked that the producer didn't edit it out. I'm not suggesting auto censure--this really isn't political correctness--the comment was totally unconnected to both story itself and to any specific context within it. The editor could have cut it the same way he might have cut a poorly recorded passage, if anything it would have improved the program...</p>

<p>So now I'm trawling the franceinter.fr website looking for the duty officer's email. I just can't believe--it I mean did they sit down and talk it through? Was it left in for a reason? I want an explanation.</p>
