<p>Well, it looks like there was a wee bit of a Le Pen effect in Oldham and Burnley. Only two council seats for the <span class="caps">BNP, </span>but they do generate a lot of publicity from that, don't they? I went for one Labour and two Green. Our Greens sent round a leaflet saying which one to vote for if you only gave them one vote. It's a good idea, unless the <span class="caps">BNP </span>start using it ;-)</p>
