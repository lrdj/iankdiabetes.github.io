<p>There's an interesting article over at <a href="http://rentzsch.com/notes/creditCardMicropayments/">rentzsch.com</a> (<cite>thanks <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">daringfireball</a></cite>) outlining his theory of how Apple has defeated the credit card handling charge on their music store. In essence, how can they afford to sell tracks for 99&cent; given the transaction charge of 50&cent;. The man is offering this up as a theory--any Visa experts out there?</p>
