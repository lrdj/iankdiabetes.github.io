<p>I was reading <a href="http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/archives/000471.html#000471">this post</a> about the Qur'an and it got me thinking, how cool it is that Muslims get their text in <i>version originale</i> (or is that wrong?). I've never been a big Bible reader, but if I were, I probably wouldn't want to read it in translation...</p>
