<p>So Billy and I went to this Alexander McQueen bash last Thursday night and drank way too much champagne and then Billy raised his paddle and bought Madonna's tights...</p>

<p>Which kinda meant that we had to talk to the Christies mob who were managing the auction which in turn meant we sorta got to meet the MD of American Express Europe who we asked to support <a href="http://www.lecturelist.org/">The Lecture List</a> by signing up to one of our fabulous whitelabel lists (which is how the Guardian is going to be getting their content).</p>

<p>So now Billy and I are wondering if anyone's going to ask us to pay for the tights ;-)</p>
