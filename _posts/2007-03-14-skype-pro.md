<p>If only I could read Japanese I would understand what <a title="エストニア独立記念日 - Skype 日本語ブログ" href="http://share.skype.com/sites/ja/2007/02/23/estonia_independence_2007.html">エストニア独立記念日 - Skype 日本語ブログ</a> is all about. As it is, all I can do is wonder at the photograph...</p>

<p>Oh, and while I came for the photo, I stayed for the kinky Skype Pro stuff. Clearly I've not being keeping up with Skype's new offerings. Is this a Skype employee blog or are they offering hosting to pro customers?</p>
