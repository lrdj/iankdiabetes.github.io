<p><a href="http://www.robbiebushe.co.uk">Robbie Bushe</a> is a life-long friend of <a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/">Billy</a> and one of the most amazing artists I've had the pleasure to know. Of course, he makes his own websites and his navigation is as rich, complex and textured as his work in oils;-)</p>

<p>In the interest of instant gratification, here is <a href="http://www.r.bushe.dial.pipex.com/cypruspics/cyprus02.html">a direct link</a> to his new Cyprus paintings (thank you Billy for pointing these out).</p>
