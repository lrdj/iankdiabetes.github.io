<p>From Wikipedia's entry on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Constellation">Lockheed Constellation</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>One Super Constellation is parked on an unused runway in the Rafael Hernandez International airport in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. It was struck by a runaway DC-4 at Aguadilla-Borinquen Airport, on 3 February 1992, resulting in damage to the right wing and main spar.</p></blockquote>

<p>You can see the wing damage in the satellite shot. Shame Google didn't have any full-res shots of Puerto Rico but still, the quality of these shots never ceases to amaze me :-)</p>
