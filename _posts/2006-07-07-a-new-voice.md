<p>I've been working with a man called Colin Wright over at Birdseye. It's been really interesting helping his team get started online. We helped the corporates look into their organisation, find a voice with a genuine passion and then stand back and let him get on with it.</p>

<p>The result is <a title="Life on the pea harvest" href="http://blogs.mtengine.com/peaharvest/">Life on the pea harvest</a>, a diary held by the team responsible for the harvest with hosting and tech support paid for by their employer.</p>

<p>I think Colin's voice resonates on a number of fundamental levels. You can't help but respect his nutty obsession with peas and his constant struggle for quality. It turns out he's got a dog too (she's called Doris) and he phones his podcasts (peapods?) in from the field every morning at 5:30 as he meditates on his life and shares his thoughts with Doris...</p>
