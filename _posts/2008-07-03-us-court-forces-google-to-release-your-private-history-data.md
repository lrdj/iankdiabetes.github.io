<p>that obtaining your personal history will in no way assist Viacom in identifying which of their intellectual properties has been illegally distributed. Please add that the phenomenal (how many millions of users?) negative impact on personal privacy utterly outweighs any spurious copyright swinery...</p>

<p>Read it: <a title="Judge Orders YouTube to Give All User Histories to Viacom | Threat Level from Wired.com" href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/07/judge-orders-yo.html">Judge orders YouTube to give all user histories to Viacom (Wired)</a> and <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/07/court-ruling-will-expose-viewing-habits-youtube-us">eff response</a> and <a href="http://www.viacom.com/corpresponsibility/Pages/globalcommunity.aspx">Viacom <span class="caps">CSR</span></a> </p>

<p>Man this is infuriating, and while I'm on the topic can I add that the <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/06/riaa-making-ava.html">making available</a> argument is tantamount to arresting car owners because their ownership <em>makes available</em> the possibility of running over a pedestrian or saying that owning a gun is legally equivalent to shooting someone:-(</p>

<p>Time to increase my donations to the <span class="caps">EFF, </span>and <a href="http://www.eff.org/action">you should too</a> OK?</p>
