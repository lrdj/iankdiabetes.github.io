<p>Salam'alicum, today is officially <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page6139.asp">Iraq dossier</a> day. The dossier is a document in which the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Ministry of Truth</span> Tony Blair attempts to explain to the nation why we should invade Iraq, topple the government and supervise "regime change". </p>

<p>As a pleb, I understand the need for a clearly defined enemy and appreciate the difficult work the Ministry has to do to ensure that I properly understand who to hate, and to make sure I send my as yet unborn son the front. All I ask, is the answer to a few questions.</p>

<p><span style="display:block;padding-left:10px;font-style:italic;"> a) Since when are sovereign states only allowed to possess weapons of moderate destruction? <br /> b) When did Tony Blair stop giving a fuck what voters of my ilk think? <br /> c) If the Americans want to act unilaterally and aren't ashamed of it, why do I need to support them? <br /> d) Why isn't anybody upset at Israel going for the <a href="http://www.dave-smith.co.uk/life/001598.php#001598">final solution</a> to the Palestinian question? <br /> e) How can the people of Iraq be expected to think and act, if they can't even eat or read? </span></p>

<p>Anyway, happy dossier day.</p>
