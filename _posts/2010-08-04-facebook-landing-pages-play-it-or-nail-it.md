<p>So here's an <a href="http://designm.ag/design/designing-a-facebook-landing-page-12-of-the-best/">article on Facebook landing pages</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The site wide uniformity of Facebook has been a flagship characteristic of the Facebook and it seems they have worked very hard to stay within their original business model. Despite this, they have created Facebook fan pages with many different apps that you can use as a way to customize your business presence. Up till now, we have mainly seen this space used for coupons and promotions.</p>

<p>This obviously isn't a tutorial on how to design a company landing page, but rather I hope to inspire you as to what successfully companies are doing within this space.</p></blockquote>

<p>So I'm asking, play it or nail it? Do we need to be actively thinking about our Facebook account or is it all just pants?</p>
