<p>But we had a great week-end. Nicki and I drove out to the Suffolk coast and spent the week-end at Andrew's wee house in Thorpeness. Andrew and Peter have just got a dog (he's called Potter) which meant lots of walks on the beach which is always uplifting.</p>

Beautiful quaint cottages which appear on closer inspection to be entirely manufactured from poured concrete - strange and wonderful. Or, following on from the previous post's pointers, poured concrete -- strange and wonderful.</p>
