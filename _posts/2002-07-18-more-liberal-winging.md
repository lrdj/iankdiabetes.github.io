<p>What is going around here? Can you believe the British government wants to remove the double jeopardy rule, make previous convictions admissible in court and do away with jury trial in some cases. No legal student, I couldn't tell you why the double jeopardy rule exists, only that without it, a government can simply keep locking up and trying dissentors.</p>
