<p>Or at least lets make sure the darn thing gets a proper debate in parliament. The bit that frightens me most: Big Copyright getting the right to disconnect my daughter from the internet. I wished I had been recording Cory Doctorow (above) instead of photographing him as he made a beautifully worded case for the absurdity of the bill.</p>

<p><i>updated: he's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILwnY1RqS64&amp;feature=player_embedded">on Youtube</a></i></p>

<p>Piracy is a problem, but it's also a red herring. The real problem is industry using it's lobbying power to manipulate copyright law and resist change. We'll know we're heading in the right direction when the rights to Mickey Mouse enters the public domain and the record industry develops a healthy business model in partnership with its customers.</p>

<p>Until then, yall need to look at supporting the <a href="http://eff.org"><span class="caps">EFF</span></a> the <a href="http://fsf.org"><span class="caps">FSF</span></a> and the <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/">Open Rights Group</a> (ORG briefing <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/ourwork/reports/brief-on-digital-economy-bill">here</a>) amongst others. Oh, that, and call your MP:-)</p>
