Perhaps more small-but-perfectly-formed. Billy and I hooked up with Ian, the painter who is doing Andrew's house. This is a good thing as walking through the forest at one in the morning drunk and armed only with a garmin etrex gps seemed like a good idea at first but in the end the back of Ian's truck was a far more realistic way home.</p>

<p>Billy and I couldn't quite get our heads around a walk in the wilderness to see a band sing about trees ;-) In any case, I just had to snap the beautiful plastic flowers at my <span class="caps">B&amp;B </span>bedside (they even have paint splatters - fantastic).</p>
