<p>So I have this recurring fantasy where I design a simple 12 volt grinding tool using a starter motor with a ferrous metal cutting wheel bolted to the axle. In my dream I have long, coiled, power lead from the motor to a cigar-lighter plug so the tool can plugged into any vehicle's socket by running the cable in the window.</p>

<p>Anyway, I've never actually gotten anywhere with the project, but <a href="http://www.anglegrinderman.co.uk/bigpic.asp?toshow=playgirl%2fimgp0031.jpg">this guy</a> has :-) Thanks to <a href="http://www.londonblog.com/">londonblog</a></p>
