<p>Don't you get tired of reading biographies on websites that say the person was there at the beginning of the commercial internet? Just as a reality check, the next time someone points out how they were writing for netscape 3 in 1994, point them to a screenshot of <a href="/i/netscapeBETA093.gif">Netscape beta 0.93</a> dated 1995 that ought to put them back into propper context ;-)</p>
