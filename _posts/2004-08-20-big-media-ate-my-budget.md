<p>It's nice when a blogger says something short and to the point:</p>

<blockquote><p>Why is Big Media Losing viewers? (...) The actual answer, which lies unspoken between the lines of all discussion on the subject, is much simpler: people are abandoning Big Media because it sucks. (From a great post by <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001397">Aaron Swartz</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm still struggling with that document I've been writing--sort of a <em>Pelican Brief</em> for ad agencies prompting them to start shaping a new kind of creative. Big media losing eyeballs is one of the bigger reasons they need to get a move on...</p>

<p>I'll post the damn thing if I can ever get it somewhere in the region of coherence.</p>
