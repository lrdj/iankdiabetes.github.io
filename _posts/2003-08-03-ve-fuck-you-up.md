<p>Just got an email which looks like a lot like spam asking me to publish a link to www.growabrain.net which claims to be a blog but looks a lot like like a 'viral' from a California estate agent? Anyway, funny link on 'his' page, a Big Lebowski <a href="http://www.dymphna.net/randomquotage/lebowskiquotes.shtml">quote generator</a>...</p>

<p>In case you'd forgotten the masterful milk-drink:</p>

<p><q> Smokey, this is not Nam, this is bowling. There are rules.</q></p>

<p>Or even</p>

<p><q> "How're you gonna keep them down on the farm when they've seen Karl Hungus?"</q></p>

<p>Anyway, you get the idea (I'd be grateful to hear your opinion on the growbrain thing--is it Microsoft in disguise or just a particularly enterprising salesman).</p>
