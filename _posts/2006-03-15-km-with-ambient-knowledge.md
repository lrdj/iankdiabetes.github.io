<p>Great piece on <a href="http://www.headshift.com/archives/002895.cfm">ambient information</a> at Headshift (I feel so left out not making it to <span class="caps">ETECH </span>seems like everybody I read online was there...).</p>

<blockquote><p>the classic open plan layout gives management far too much latitude for interruption and individuals and groups too little room for private work</p></blockquote>

<p>Well worth the time to get through the whole thing.</p>
