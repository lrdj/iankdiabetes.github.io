<p>I'm still working on the next release of this blogging system (no time for personal web projects - work plus decorating leaves no leisure time) but even in its crude state, a couple of friends have decided to set one up (they still haven't edited their templates much, so they look a bit like this site) so I thought I'd post their urls.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/">Billy</a> (my sister's husband, you remember) has started posting in brief moments between discussing utterance interpretation. Recently, he's been getting into bondage and discipline;-)</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/jasr/">Jos&eacute;-Antonio</a> started posting yesterday. He is an old friend from New York - it's good to have him keeping a log, as it fits his role as an honorary member of the Society for the Advancement of Formal Structures (it's a long story). In any case, check out his site.</p>
