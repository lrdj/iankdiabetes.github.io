<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>so I haven't commented on Flash in a while. I have just had to struggle with <a href="http://www.scoutvision.com">a site</a> that was determined to conceal the information I wanted to find, and as I struggled past the beautiful, smooth animated typography, an analogy sprang to mind...</p>

<p>Imagine you're finishing up on the bog and you reach for the paper, but that every time you try and rip a sheet off, the roll winds up, and slowly tells you about how Nouvelle respects both nature and your bottom to the sound of a crap techno loop, and that to get a sheet, you just pull down towards the floor... By the third time, you'd be using old newspaper.</p>

<p>I got a telephone message from a woman in America wanting information about a client and was simply trying to confirm her email address. You'd think a company's website might be a good place to look for an employee's email? Unfortunately, the site is completely static and is un-editable by the company, so contains no such current info.</p>

<p>Oh, but it is pretty;-)</p>
