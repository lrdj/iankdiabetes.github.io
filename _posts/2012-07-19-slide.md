<p>Went out on the <a href="http://loadedboards.com/boards/tan-tien/">Tan Tien</a> after work yesterday and finally managed to break traction. I'm running the <a href="http://www.orangatangwheels.com/">86a stims</a> (the yellow ones) but in classic newbie fashion I'm confused about the right compound to be learning to slide on. Forums aren't much help as <a href="http://www.silverfishlongboarding.com/forum/longboard-skateboarding-wheels-bearings/208628-86a-stims.html">nobody agrees on anything</a></p>

<p>Anyways, I weigh a ton so even the hard compound of the stims is still quite sticky, I can carve pretty hard without any loss of traction.</p>

<p>So anyways, I've been heading to the park in the rain as the wet tarmac is slippier and yesterday finally managed to break the back out while pumping. The thought of carving/pumping hard at speed into a stand-up is still extremely frightening but I figure if I practise enough to learn the feel of of the back coming away I might stand a chance and be able to do some big hills some day.</p>

<p>So that was good and I was feeling pretty comfortable so walked to the top of the run, started carving down and chickened out in front of a bump. Never mind sliding, I still need to perfect my whipping out at speed. The stupid thing is that if I hadn't chicken out I could have fairly easily got to the bottom of the run in one piece... Anyways, the sooner I learn speedchecks the sooner I can start to enjoy downhill:-)</p>
