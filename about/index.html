  Hi I'm Dug and this is my blog. I am a designer who has recently moved to Scotland. I am married to Nicki and have two child units, CLF and HEF.</p>
  <p>
  These posts go all the way back to 2001. When I started blogging I didn't like the tools available so wrote my own in some dodgy middle-ware called <a href="http://www.pageplanetsoftware.com/mgi2.html" title="unbelievably this product is still living!">MGI</a> that ran on OS9 WebSTAR (yes, really!). A couple of years in, I discovered <a href="http://movabletype.com">Movable Type</a> and was a happy customer for many years. The current version of this blog is hosted on Github and is built using Jekyll. The template is a hack based on the great work of <a href="http://jacobberchem.com/" title="lovely layout and shmancy responsive image behaviours - have removed most of these but they're pretty cool and Jacob's portfolio is well worth a visit">Jacob Berchem</a> and <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/artist-theme/" title="Awesome image handling - the translucency background and typography effects are stolen from Nina - thanks!">Nina Petropoulos</a> - please do check out their sites:-)</p>

  Re content, the theme has changed over the years. There was a period of heavy consumer activism, a few years all about babies and deaths in the family, quite a few posts about design, usability, politics and so on. The main challenge is the fact the blog has no central theme so struggles to compete with other specialist sites. I guess at this stage, it's a place for me to experiment and also a repository for my voice so the kids have something when I'm gone (but not in a ghoulish way).</p>

  If you'd like to create some content or services together I'm always keen to meet new people and share cups of tea. <a href="mailto:dug@goodlookslikethis.com">Reach out by email</a> and if you'd like to see some slightly more focused content my UX work site is here for now: <a href="http://goodlookslikethis.com">goodlookslikethis.com</a></p>
