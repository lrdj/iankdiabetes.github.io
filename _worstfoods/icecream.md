Name: "Ice Cream"
Top5: "2"
Why: "I love ice cream in all shapes and sizes but really need to avoid it nowadays. Essentially, it's a combination of carbohydrates -- aka sugars that I try to avoid adding in refined form to my diet (I get plenty of carbs in the fruit and vegetables I eat, no need to add extras), and fat -- aka concentrated calories. My insulin system takes the extra carbs and lays them down as fat and the fat takes me over my calorie allowance pushing me towards my fat threshold (the point at which pancreatic beta-cell function begins to fail). To be clear I eat a lot of fat, it is not inherently bad for you, it's just you need to track it mindfully. Foods with high concentrations of fat like ice cream make managing your input more difficult. Finally, if I have an ice cream cone that means I need to shave off some energy somewhere else in the day and that makes me hungry and makes my energy management unreliable. Best to stay away from the delicious cold stuff if you can:-)"

The top 5 worst foods for my diabetes

Snickers bars (not just calories but concentrated fats and sugars)
Ice cream (sugar with added fat!)
Toast (my slippery-slope food, a platform for sugary stuff sitting on a layer of fat)
Crisps (soooo tempting and soooo damaging)
Sandwiches (probably the main reason I got into trouble in the first place, hidden carbs and calories wrapped up in convenience. Promotes lack of mindfulness)
