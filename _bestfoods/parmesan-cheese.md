Name: "Parmesan cheese"
Top5: "5"
Why: "If I had to describe why I've voted certain foods as top-5 in the fight to lower your blood sugar I could simply overlay one of the low-GI guides and we'd be done. What makes these foods my faves is that they are not only low-GI, they are all delicious and very satisfying, helping a fairly strict dish of ra vegetables tak on a whole new feel. I use parmesan grated or diced, in hot soups and dishes and always in salads. Like wlnuts, you need to be a little careful with your fats. You want to eat them for all their benefits (they make you feel satisfied and provide essential nutrients) but you need to keep an eye on how much you eat as they pack a lot of calories."
