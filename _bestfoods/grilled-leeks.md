Food: "Broccoli"
Top5: 4
Why: "Here's the thing. You take two medium-sized leeks (300 grams chopped adding up to only 69 calories!) slice them up diagonally and drop them in a non-stick frying pan at high heat and before long you have a meaty, arromatic dish. Keep them moving and keep an eye on the colour but this is one of my favourite base-layers. They are great with chopped chesnut mushrooms added half-way through or olives and walnuts stired in at the end with some lemon juice and soy-sauce. Absolutely love these and not a high GO thing in sight:-)"
