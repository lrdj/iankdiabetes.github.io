Name: "Roast Ham"
Top5: "3"
Why: "Roast ham, even honey roast ham packs the absolute maximum flavour and satisfaction into a the leanest, low-calory package. I discivered Marks & SPencers 'Just add' packets designed to add to salads (I think) and one of those packs of roast ham is delicious and filling and only 180 calories. This thing is your friend for now. Once you reach maintenance or long-slow weight loss you'll want to take a look at how many cured or prepared meats you're eating as these do contain a number of nasties. In my case that finess made no sense in the face of the diabetes and the need for massive weight loss. Now that I'm thinner I've tapered off the ham a little bit"
