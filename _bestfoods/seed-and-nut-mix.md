Name: "Seed and nut mix"
Top5: "2"
Why: "Everything tastes more like real food with nuts in it. Unless you are allergic, I would strongly suggest you keep a big bag of walnuts in the kitchen. Adding them to just about any dish, whether a salad or something hot makes that dish a more satisfying meal. Nuts are the closest thing to steak that isn't steak. Just keep an eye on the weight measurement, they pack a lot of calories so remember to track carefully once you're on maintenance (in the fast phase you can only squeeze three or four walnut halves into your dish so arguably not worth it but that's for you to decide)"
